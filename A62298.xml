         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing informed of the great number of <hi>Quakers</hi> in and about <hi>Old-Samford;</hi> and conſidering the deſtructive Opinions of thoſe that teach among them; the certain eternal ruine of them, if in all things they ſhould believe and practiſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine, of ſome at leaſt, of theſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: As <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the <hi>Athenians</hi> wholly given to Idolatry; ſo my Bowels yearned towards this miſguided Flock; of which, many, I am perſwaded, truly breathing after Salvation, are led away, as thoſe two hundred men that went after <hi>Abſolom</hi> in the ſimplicity of their hearts, and know not whither theſe Teachers are leading them. What might be done to ſtop the erroneous courſe of this people? If theſe that take upon them to preach among them, ſaw the evil of their own wayes, it would be a good ſtep to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of many. Is it impoſſible that theſe ſhould be informed? I told a Friend that lived near the place, I could willingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſome of their Teachers, had I an opportunity, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only at a private Conſerence. About a year after, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon directs two <hi>Quakers</hi> to my Houſe with a Letter, which when I opened, I found, that whereas <hi>I</hi> had challenged to diſpute
<pb facs="tcp:101119:3"/>with them, they required theſe may be the Queſtions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that time and place may be agreed upon. I wondred at this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for before, the <hi>Quakers</hi> utterly diſclaimed any ſuch thing as a Challenge: Yet conſidering that a Diſpute would draw <hi>Quakers</hi> to it, who are utterly averſe from hearing any that preach the wholſom Doctrine of the Goſpel; and thus there might be an advantage of clearing up the Truths of God before them: it may be the Lord will convince ſome of them at leaſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue them from that deſtruction their Teachers are drawing them into. I conſented. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice in the School of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> was my Encouragement and my Hope, truſting in the Lord for help, and ſetting his Glory, the advancement of Truth, and the ſalvation of ſouls before mine Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Place being appointed, the Day come, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> appearing my <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> I demanded, <hi>Whether he would grant the Scriptures to be a Truth, or no?</hi> This Principle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeilded, to bottom an Argument upon, I required ſilence, to begin with Prayer: This was flouted at <hi>[Thou haſt thy God to ſeek.]</hi> Thus did he, ſhewing a ſcornful, proud, ſelf-confident Spirit, deride the ſolemn Worſhip of God, who is to be ſanctified in all things; eſpecially in undertakongs of this nature; in that he only can enlighten and lead us into Truth, and all aſſembled ſtood in need of his teaching. Gods people ſurely are a Generation of ſuch as ſeck his face: I returned not reviling for reviling, <hi>I</hi> came for another purpoſe: I further preſs'd for ſilence. He continuing to diſſent: I did however, though the more briefly, ſeek Gods preſence among his people, and his Vindication of what is Truth. This done, Concerning the Scriptures, I aſſerted them to be a moſt certain and infallible Rule. He bids me prove it. This was my Argument: <hi>[That which is given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God to guide us to heaven, cannot but be a moſt certain and infallible Rule: But ſo are the Scriptures.]</hi> He granted the Scriptures were given by inſpiration; but inſtead of ſhewing how theſe may deceive us notwithſtanding (which indeed is impoſſible) he rambles, and runs out in an impertinent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as if he were preaching, rather than diſputing. And this was his manner, when to prove the Scriptures a trying Rule, I urged an Argument from the example of the <hi>Bereans.</hi> That which God approves of is our Duty: But God approves of it, that we try Doctrines by the Scripture: This therefore is
<pb facs="tcp:101119:3"/>our duty. He would not hearken to this argument, nor attempt to give any anſwer at all to it, though repeated three or four times: but flies to another thing, rambling tediouſly. Indeed to prove Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he brought ſeveral Arguments and Scriptures, one after another ſomewhat cloſely; and having received diſtinct Anſwers to them, he fairly ceaſed, being unable to make good his Aſſertion; and heard my Argument to the contrary: But then grow moſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious again in his repetitions and impertinences. I was too mild to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. But when entring upon Juſtification, I ſaw that he hid himſelf in impertinent, long anſwers; and that the day was now far ſpent; that I might not be prevented in what I chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, the diſcovery of the only way of Juſtification by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed; that people might ſee whither theſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were leading them; and prevent, if God ſaw good, their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation of body and ſoul: I reſolved, I would not regard him; but deliver ſomething to the People touching this point for their inſtruction and ſafety. Three Arguments I delivered, and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf on them freely and fully to the People, and would not be interrupted; preſſing them, as they deſired to eſcape condemnation at Gods Barr, to look for Juſtification in nothing elſe but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt imputed; to fly to Chriſt, and build only on his Blood and Righteouſneſs, as that alone that is able to ſatisfie God for their tranſgreſſion. And having done this, I commended all to God by Prayer, and went away. The People ſeeing how I was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by this mans tedious enlargements, deſired another dayes diſpute. I told <hi>G. W.</hi> by a Letter, that if he would give it in Writing, that what Queſtion is asked pertinent to the point in hand, it ſhould be anſwered expreſly by affirming or denying it, the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being capable of ſuch an anſwer; I was willing to meet him a ſecond time: And that it might be lawful for others alſo to ſpeak, his friends and mine, that ſo we might carry the Diſpute on, and the People attend, through this veriety, with leſs wearineſs. He uſeth many ſhifts to keep off from this engagement; I being perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, knowing without this he would ramble, but not diſpute; at length he gives this under his hand! <hi>[I do intend according to my underſtanding to be as poſitive and intelligible in my Anſwers to Queſtions pertinent, as I can; and in my Anſwer to ſignifie an Affirmation or Denial, if the Queſtion be capable of ſuch an Anſwer.]</hi> Having this Engagement, I did hope he would keep cloſe to the point; or at leaſt that I ſhould force him to it. I met and put
<pb facs="tcp:101119:4"/>him to his affirmation, or denyal; either the Scripture is a full Rule or not? Either Gods will laid down in Scripture is the only Rule or not? Whilſt he expreſt himſelf pertinently, I liſtned giving him all Liberty; but when he began to ramble (for he knew not how to keep bounds, having run wild ſo long) I checkt him, and required his affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or denial. And thus holding him to it, the Lord was pleaſed much to ſucceed my attempts; They were forced, though with as much reluctancy as a Bear to the Stake; they were forced, I ſay, to acknowledge the Truth; and this in the very eſſential Differences between us and them. It was acknowledged openly that <hi>[the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a full Rule.]</hi> That, <hi>[The will of God laid down in the Scripture is the only Rule.]</hi> That, <hi>[The will of God reveled by the Light in every man, without the Scripture, is not the only Rule.]</hi> And if theſe things be granted, what becomes of Quakery? What is Quakery but the ſetting up of the Light in every Man as a Rule to Heaven? They granting the firſt, bruiſed Quakery very ſorely; granting the ſecond they knockt Quakers down to the ground; grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third they fetcht out the very heart blood of Quakery. Let but theſe three granted truths live in the hearts of all, and Quakery muſt needs give up the Ghoſt; it is impoſſible there ſhould be one Quaker on the face of the Earth. For, if the Scriptures are a full Rule: It cannot be denyed but that all thoſe who walk according to this Rule in uprightneſs are in the way to ſalvation. A full Rule will, if practiſed, ſafely bring us to glory. What reaſon poſſibly can there be to deſert this, to be guided by the Light within? If the will of God revealed in the Scriptures be the only Rule, then all other Rules are falſe Rules, and no Rules; then who ever walks by any other Rule, is not in the way to heaven, muſt needs periſh at laſt and be damned for ever: What bloody enemies are they to the ſouls of men that counſel and direct them to ſeek ſalvation by walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any other Rule; what great Reaſon have we to cleave to Gods will laid down in Scripture; there being but one way to heaven, and this is it? Men muſt ſeek the way to heaven where it is to be found, if they would not miſs of it. Again, If the will of God <hi>(as much of it as is)</hi> revealed by the Light in every man, without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be not the only Rule to ſalvation; when there is but one, this cannot be any Rule at all to ſalvation: thoſe that walk by no other Rule but this, muſt not look to be ſaved; thoſe that counſel to walk by no other, make themſelves guilty of the blood of ſouls. Suppoſe a City had but One only way leading into at; a man were to be burnt
<pb facs="tcp:101119:4"/>alive if he gets not into this City by the evening; in his travel asking one the way, he bids him open ſuch a Gate on the right hand, and he ſhould ſee before him the only way that leads into the City: asking another, he acknowledgeth that if he opens the Gate on the right hand he ſhould ſee before him the only way; yet bids him take a Lane on the left hand. If through the Gate on the right hand be the only way; how can the Lane on the left, be any way at all leading into the City? If the Traveller takes that Lane, he looſeth his Life, and the Miſ-informer is guilty of his death. By this is appears, from what hath been confeſſed; that the Light in every man is no way at all to Heaven; that he that walks by no other Rule, is to burn everlaſtingly in Hell; and he that acknowledgeing Gods will laid down in Scripture the only Rule, counſels to walk by no other Rule ſave the Light in every man, is a Murderer of ſouls, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contriver of their damnation. Oh! that God would give ſuch to ſee their Crimſon Tranſgreſſion, and break their hearts, and turn them to himſelf, that they may be ſaved. If not; that he would at leaſt reſcue a miſerable flock out of their devouring mouths. And yet I ſee but little hopes of the former, for though thus overborn by the Power of Truth, they have the Face ſtill to appear against it, and in Print vapour as if the day were their own; and [<hi>their Women Friends are able to confute us ſhattered Prieſts. Glory of Chriſts Light within.</hi> p. <hi>11.</hi>] Thus Bankrupts, unable to ſubſiſt make a flouriſh; fain would they keep up their credit in the World, though they cannot their eſtates. But where was this flouriſh then, when refuſing to affirm or deny the will of God in Scripture, the only Rule; I challenged them all ſeaven upon the ſtage, One by one, to deny it if they durſt; and they heavy-hearted men durst not a good while give me any Anſwer: deny it they could not, the truth is ſo plain to aſſirm it they ſaw were to knock down to the ground their unſound Opinion. If they repent not of their errors, they will be far from glorying at the Bar of Chriſt. In their Narrative I can eaſily overlook their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful ſpeeches. Presbyterian Prieſt, <hi>p. 3. Shattered Prieſts,</hi> p. <hi>11. Dead men, becauſe</hi> Cromwel <hi>the Light of their eyes is dead.</hi> p. <hi>13. Ignorant Oppoſer.</hi> p. <hi>35.

Really in Hell, imptatively in Heaven. <hi>p. 37.</hi> It is in their powers to ſave and damn whom they pleaſe? Their vain glorious boasting renders them Real Objects of pity and compaſſion.

Were their cauſe good, their call clear, and their carriage holy, their ſufferings had been acceptable to God. But they ſuffer not for the upholding all Gods Ordinances in the purity of them, rather for Preaching down Baptiſm, for Preaching down the Supper, for Preaching down the Scripture as no Rule that will guide to Heaven, and inſtead of theſe Ordinances of God, they ſet up an Ordinance of their own, which God never appointed for his Church, Dumb Meetings.

               </gap>dinary caſes we read of Prophets, and others Dumb for a time; but which of the Prophets, which of the Apoſtles ever did ordinarily, from week to week aſſemble Gods people together, and was in like manner dumb amongſt them? Or where did God ever command his Church to meet from time to time, to ſit and look one upon another. The Cauſe being bad, it is impoſſible they ſhould have a Call from God. They are then but Will-ſufferings. And yet if both Cauſe and Call were good; this vain glorious carriage would of it ſelf ſpoil all. Our Saviour bids, <hi>when they Perſecute in one City, fly to another.</hi> And he himſelf could withdraw into a deſart place in time of his Diſciples fears. And when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought his Life, could walk no more openly. And the Apoſtles according to Christs Counſel and Practice, could withdraw from place to place; yet ſo, as ſtill going on with their work. But theſe must be ſeen in the ſame place, however threatned; and then to boast of it when they have
<pb facs="tcp:101119:5"/>done, as if they had wrought ſome meritorious work; to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſuch Saints for this; and to deſpiſe others, who when they have a Call, can through Gods aſſiſtance, and do ſubmit to ſufferings; at other times rather chooſe to tread in the ſteps of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: Theſe, ſaith God, <hi>are a ſmoak in my Noſe.</hi> The proud, vain glorious Phariſees loſt all their Prayers. Vain glorious <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> after they had parted with a great portion of their eſtates to be reputed Religious, muſt part with their Souls alſo. Above all perſons therefore boaſting ſufferers are to be pitied, becauſe they are like to be double ſufferers, and but ſingle gainers; they have their reward. But there is One thing in their Narrative relating to my Brethren, which I dare charge them withall, that is, Slander, as I verily believe. They give out <hi>p. 10.</hi> That ſome of us employ men (for they call them our Agents,) to go from houſe to houſe to beg money for us: And <hi>p. 11.</hi> That ſome of us have compacted with the Miniſters of the Pariſh, to give them a part of the money if they will permit them to make again of their ſlock by Preaching to them. If they prove not theſe things true, they must needs be looked on as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſlander. And there are two things in it relating to my ſelf, which I complain of. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nupright, diſ-ingenuous dealing; and falſhood. Of the former, becauſe when they write <hi>G.W.</hi> his proofs, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make no mention of my Anſwers. They omit ſeveral of the Arguments I urged in both Diſputes. They lay not down the ſtrength of others as urged. They lay down what frivolous thing they pleaſe as an Argument of mine, which I never brought in as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>p. 28. This is not a full Light, for God created the Starrs which are not a full Light.</hi> Alſo <hi>p. 29. If it convinceth of ſin, then not of the contrary. Theſe are none of my Concluſions.</hi> They moreover impute harſh and uncouth ſpecches to me. <hi>p. 19. That I ſhould ſay; the Light in its common operations is given to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. p. 28. That 'tis not given to all. And p. 38. By the Righteouſneſs of Faith Juſtified perſons are ſanctified.</hi> Theſe are none of my ſayings. Of falſhood the Latter, I complain in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. They affirm, <hi>p. 4.</hi> That I ſhould ſay, <hi>The Light within might ſave them that have not the Scriptures.</hi> I never affirmed this, a full account of what I ſaid follows in the cloſe of that Queſtion <hi>[Whether the Light in every man be ſaving.]</hi> And again, <hi>p. 33. That I ſhould ſay, Go Baptize ye Rebels.</hi> Though I called them Rebels, and proved it, of which too afterwards; yet I affirm this a
<pb facs="tcp:101119:6"/>falſhood, I never looked on ſuch fellows as Miniſters of Christ fit to Baptize. Further, <hi>p. 7.</hi> It was uſual with this <hi>S. S.</hi> When he could not Reply, to make a noiſe. I know nothing urged pertinent, but it had its anſwer. I affirm it to be a falſhood, that any thing that was urged I could not anſwer. Moreover, <hi>p. 24.</hi> They give out that I dired them to affirm or deny before they refuſed. Another falſhood. <hi>p. 12</hi> Theſe Prieſts hold men are Imputatively Righteous, whilſt Actually ſinners. Take ſinners for Perſons in whom ſin is not perfectly aboliſht, and thoſe that are Righteous by Imputation are ſuch;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.17. Eccl. 7.20.</note> take ſinners for Perſons allowing themſelves in ſin; and this is a groſs falſhood. <hi>G. W.</hi> Would have impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtned upon me, this aſſertion in the Diſpute; <hi>That I ſaid, Water Baptiſm is neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> I then checkt him to his Face, and renounced it openly as not ſaid by me. Yet against all this Light, theſe men have the Faces to faſten it ſtill upon me. I affirmed then, and do ſtill, the contempt of it is Damnation: Yet it is not neceſſary, as Faith is neceſſary. The <hi>Thief was ſaved without it.</hi> To theſe falſhoods I ſhall adde, with reference to <hi>G.W.</hi> That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bargained and agreed with me under his hand to ſignifie his affirmation or Denial to all Queſtions that ſhould be asked pertinent to the point in hand; whether I demanded his Affirmation or Denial, ten, or fifteen, or twenty times or more <hi>(for I frequently did it, yet could ſcarce at all get it from him. I do not remember one time; for when I extorted the Conceſſions mentioned, 'twas one of his Brethren by, that yielded to me; he was obſtinately neutral; durſt not deny, the things were ſo plain: yet would neither be Ingenuous nor faithful to confeſs the truth, any other way then by his ſilence, or his not openly contradicting him that did confeſs it.)</hi> I do pronounce him guilty of falſhood ſo many times as he refuſed to affirm or deny. And are theſe the Saints? The men that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſent from God? Infallibly inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt that they cannot erre? In <hi>Thaxtead</hi> I have been credibly informed, a Quaker ſtiled this <hi>G. W.</hi> an Angel from heaven; A very black one, if he be. Theſe two laſt things complained of engage my Pen; becauſe I ſee the Doctrine of Chriſt ſharing with me in my ſufferings by them: which I must not brook. My deſign in Writing being the Readers Profit; I ſhall not barely relate the Particulars of the Diſputes, but pointing at them as I go, ſhall (God aſſiſting) handle the ſix Queſtions in Order, Opening them as far as I judge needful;
<pb facs="tcp:101119:6"/>laying down Scripture or Reaſon for what we hold, examining what the Adverſary hath ſaid againſt it, whether in the Diſpute, or in the Narrative ſince, or in his Book ſtiled the Divinity of Chriſt, or any other of his Writings that come to hand. And herein, I hope, I ſhall deal more candidly with my Adverſary then I have been dealt with all my ſelf, not bauking his ſtrength, but improving it rather. For Truth fears no Weapons. Doing this I ſhall commit all to a good God, even the Biſhop of our ſouls; who will bring all his ſheep into his fold, and cauſe them to hear his voyce, and give them eternal life; never ſuffer them to periſh, nor any to pluck them out of his hand. You that are Godly, do and will ſtrike in with the deſign of my endeavours, by your prayers: That Truth might prevail and find more generally entertainment in the hearts of men; to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Kingdom, glory of Gods name, and eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of never-dying ſouls. And my request for you is, that having received the Love of the Truth, you might by Chriſt be rooted and grounded therein for ever, and ſo at last be preſented holy, unblameable, and unreproved in his ſight.

Now be your own Judges; is not that a good and a ſafe courſe for you to take, which is ſo for others? You may not then ſay, it is impoſſible I ſhould be deceived touching my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Opinion, becauſe my heart perſwades me it is right. As a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt may not thus argue, ſo neither may you: For the Heart is deceitful above all things. He that truſts to his own Heart is a Fool. Lean not, ſaith God, to thine own underſtanding. Neither may you ſay, it cannot be that I ſhould be miſtaken in this, for ſuch and ſuch have taught it. A <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Socinian</hi> may not thus pin his Faith on anothers ſleeve; for deceitful workers transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt: therefore neither may you: Our Saviour cautions you; take heed that no Man deceive you: commands you, call no man Maſter on Earth: and threatens too, Curſed be the man that truſteth in man. Nor may you ſay, it is impoſſible I ſhould be out, for I have an infallible ſpirit that will not ſuffer me to erre in any thing. As a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> an <hi>Independant,</hi> an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> may not thus build his conſidence; ſo neither may you. It is incumbent on you as well as on them, to try the ſpirits whether they be of God. Your work then is, looking up for ſpecial aſſiſtance, to examine the grounds of what you and others hold, to prove all things, that you may hold faſt that which is good. And truly a well grounded knowledge, is a very choice mercy. Wiſdome and knowledge, ſaith God, ſhall be the Stability of thy times and Strength of Salvation. For your furtherance herein, if the Lord ſhall adde his bleſſing; I put this ſmall book into your hands: It will preſent you with the grounds of what your Teachers hold for truth; and what we hold, Read, and Judge which have cleareſt reaſon for what they hold, which have Scripture taken in its true ſenſe and meaning. And as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, If God be God, follow him; if Baal be God, follow him.</hi> So ſay I to you, If what we teach be well built upon a ſure foundation, embrace it. If what yours teach be
<pb facs="tcp:101119:8"/>rightly drawn from ſound Principles, cleave to it for ever. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it ſpeaks a Generous and a free Spirit, to be able with Candor and Impartiality to read an Adverſary. But unleſs Gods ſpirit enlightens your mind, you may ſee truth, and not perceive; it unleſs he ſanctifies your heart, you may perceive it, and not embrace or practiſe it: You muſt therefore needs beg for the gracious preſence of God with you, if you would bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit your ſouls by reading. Examine your ſelves alſo whether you have a Love of the Truth, a Readineſs to acknowledge and cloſe with it, whether it ſhall appear to be your own opinion, or ours? If you are reſolved in heart to caſt away our doctrine, though it ſhould never ſo clearly appear to be the truth of God; to retain what you have received from your Teachers, though it ſhould never ſo plainly be diſcovered error; to what good intent can you read? It is not Truth you are for, but a Party. But if you can be willing to take in Truth on which hand ſoever you find it; then are you capable to aim at and receive profit by Reading. What do you ſay? How do you find it with you? <hi>If our preſent Opinion ſhall appear to be Truth, we can hold to it: Thats not ſo difficult a buſineſs. But what if the contrary Opinion proves true? If it ſhould indeed, we hope through Gods grace we ſhould not reject it. Only Truth leads to Heaven: we ſhould otherwiſe provoke God to give us up to ſtrong deluſions to believe a lie that we might be damned.</hi> This is like Perſons that are in good earneſt for Heaven. But it is good for you to conſider before hand, that it is no eaſie thing to part with an Opinion, you have been long wedded to, and it may be commended, and contended for; to be reconciled to an Opinion, at which you have, it may be, for ſeveral years taken diſtaſt, and oppoſed; and to expoſe your ſelf to diſgrace, by openly, as it were, proclaiming your own ignorance during that time; and by becoming unconſtant to what you have ſo long profeſſed: to bear the reproach, ill will and malice of your own Party; they will contemptuouſly call you Apoſtates, and what not. What do you <hi>now</hi> ſay to the matter? Can you ſtill hold your purpoſe? Now you begin to ſtagger. The Devil is an utter enemy to Truth; he knows it leads to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In this caſe therefore he will be prompting, <hi>what ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard thou doſt run,</hi> ſpare thy ſelf.

Unleſs the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſtand by you, thus will you deal with Truth, if our Opinion appear to be it; you will look on't with as much malignity, as on a ſpiteful enemy that would take away all that ever you have, you would be ſure to bar it out of your hearts. But the Lord will enable all his ſavingly to take in his Truth. Concerning ſuch, the Apoſtle could ſay, God hath choſen you to Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth. Seek therefore your help from the Lord. If he ſhall graciouſly transform you by the renewing of your mind, in ſpite of fleſh and blood, Earth and Hell, you ſhall prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

It will render the whole world of ungodly men unexcuſable at the laſt day; even
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101119:10"/>thoſe that have not the Scriptures, as well as thoſe that have: For they cannot ſay but that they underſtood ſomething of Gods Will, which yet they have not practiſed. This Light (let men term it how they pleaſe) is nothing elſe but mans Reaſon: For ſince it is none of the four Lights firſt mentioned, let any tell what elſe can it be? Take away any of thoſe Lights from within a man, he ſtill hath Light, or a Principle of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge remaining in him: But take away Reaſon, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light is gone.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> and the people called <hi>Quakers</hi> lies here. <hi>They hold,</hi> that the Light in every man is the Rule that directs to Heaven; that the Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be embraced ſo far only as it agrees with this Light. <hi>We hold,</hi> That the Scripture is the Rule that directs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that the Light within every man therefore is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded ſo far only as it agrees with the Scripture. Now, though we both agree, that neither of theſe is wholly to be caſt off; yet that men might ſee, which of them is to be embraced as the higheſt and ſafeſt Rule, which of them is to be rejected in competition with the other, I aſſert theſe things concerning the Scriptures: 1. That they are a full Rule. 2. That the Will of God laid down in them is the only Rule 3. That they are a Trying Rule. 4. A Binding Rule, and that in thoſe things of which the Light in every man ſaith nothing. 5. An infallible Rule to Heaven. If theſe things be made good; and on the contrary, ſo much cannot be ſaid for the Light in every man that it is a full Rule: that Gods Will as much as is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, is the only Rule, that it is a trying Rule, a bin ing Rule in thoſe things in which the Scripture ſaith nothing, an infallible Rule and Guide to Heaven: then it will appear we have greater reaſon to cleave to Scripture than to the Light that is in every man, as the higheſt and ſafeſt Rule to Heaven. I aſſert, 1. The Scriptures are a <hi>full</hi> Rule: a Rule diſcovering all things neceſſary to Salvation: the whole Mind and Will of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101119:11"/>God concerning his Churches duty, according to which, if we ſincerely endeavour to walk, 'tis impoſſible we ſhould miſs of Heaven. This Aſſertion they would have me prove in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Diſpute: Nay, ſaid I, we will differ: firſt you ſhall grant it or deny it. Loath they were to grant; deny they could not: But being preſs'd to it, it was acknowledged, that the Scriptures are a full Rule. And ſo ought all men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; for ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30 7. <hi>Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</hi> There needs no addition to Gods Words written to make them a full Rule to Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by inſpiration of God; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto every good work</hi> If the Scriptures can direct Gods Church and People to every good work, then there is not any duty they are bound to, not any good Work, but they are there directed to it, conſequently they are a moſt full Rule unto Salvation. What good reaſon have all to cleave to this Rule? It cannot he denied, that they who walk by it, take the right way to Salvation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth and keepeth the words of the Prophecy of this Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men ſeeing their Cauſe wounded by this Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, would fain lick themſelves whole again by this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p.</hi> 9. Though the Will of God laid down in Scripture be <hi>the Rule,</hi> &amp; <hi>p.</hi> 27, <hi>the full Rule,</hi> yet <hi>this Will is that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Light within, and the Spirit of God, within, to guide us into all Truth. A.</hi> They ſpeak impertinently here of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which by the Scriptures, and not without, leads all the faithful into all Truth: The Spirit is one thing, the Light in every man, of which we now diſpute, another. When they ſay 'tis Gods will laid down in Scripture, that we follow the Light within. I ask, Do they mean that we follow the Light in every man as a full Rule? Then let them ſhew, where doth the Scripture point at this Light as a full Rule. Do they mean, that we follow this Light, and go not againſt Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in thoſe things which it is able to direct us, agreeing with the Scriptures, indeed amongſt a thouſand Commands in Scripture, this is one, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46 5, 6, 7, 8. God calls on thoſe that would worſhip him by ſimilitudes, to <hi>ſhew themſelves men,</hi> to act according to reaſon, which is able to tell them that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing viſible can repreſent Gods Excellencies. I ſaid before,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101119:11"/>that the Light in every man is not wholly to be caſt off; nor do any of us ſay the voice of Conſcience is to be ſlighted, but obeyed, ſo far as it ſpeaks according to Scripture: this dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates nothing from the fulneſs of the Scripture. How would theſe miſerable men unſay what they have ſaid? Will they ſay that, that ſingle Command of regarding the Light in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in what it can ſpeak according to Scripture, is of it ſelf alone all the fulneſs of the Scripture? Alas, this were to ſay that there is nothing elſe in all the Scriptures, but that one ſingle Command repeated over and over; for if there be a thouſand more, and Exhortations and Reproofs, and Threats and Promiſes, and approved Examples, and Goſpel-Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do all concur to the fulneſs of the Scripture. the Wound bleeds ſtill: a fulneſs they have acknowledged to be in Scripture, and cannot go back. Whoever them give themſelves up to walk according to Scripture rule, cannot miſs of Heaven: whoever caſt off the Scriptures either in whole or in part, caſt off that rule that would fully guide them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, our Adverſaries themſelves being Judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>G. W.</hi> objects, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>You granted we have but part of the Scriptures</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do theſe men fight with themſelves? Would they prove the Scriptures no full rule, and yet acknowledge they are? Some Books the Prophets wrote are loſt indeed, as the Book of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and the Propheſie of <hi>Ahijah</hi> the <hi>Shilonite,</hi> and the Viſion of <hi>Iddo</hi> the Seer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.29. The Book of <hi>Themajah</hi> the Prophet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.15. and others. Yet what was the Canon, and what God deſigned to be his Churches Rule in all future Ages, is entirely preſerved, and ſhall be unto the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs, but one jot or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law</hi> (the Churches Rule) <hi>till all be fulfilled.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Propheſie, unto which ye do well to attend, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the Day</hi> (of Glory) <hi>dawn, and the Day ſtar ariſe in your hearts;</hi> till having overcome, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 28. the Lord Chriſt be received into your hearts by Viſion, as now by Faith. Thus we may ſee cauſe to rejoyce in the Scriptures as a full Rule to Heaven, though many Writings of the Prophets are loſt.</p>
               <p>Can this he ſaid for the Light in every man, that it is alſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101119:12"/>a full rule? Concerning it, I yield, that without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures this Light is able to diſcover ſomething of God and his Mind and Will unto us. It can reveal that there is a God, that he is to be feared, loved, truſted in, worſhipped, that his Name is to be reverenced, that ſome time is to be ſet apart for his worſhip; that Parents are to be honoured, Magiſtrates ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, Children provided for; that we are to love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not take away one anothers Life unjuſtly; that we are to fly Adultery, Stealing, Cheating, Lying, to tender our Neigbours good Name. Theſe things have been found amongſt Heathens, that enjoy not Scripture nor ſupernatural Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And in theſe things, becauſe the Light in every man ſpeaks according to Scripture, we are to attend unto it. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that it can without the Scripture ſhew to us our whole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or that without the Scripture it can ſhew to any enough to ſave them. Yea, I deny that this Light can of it ſelf, and without ſupernatural Revelation direct any to take one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Salvation. I ſhall firſt examine whether this Light can be proved a full Rule, then confirm what's here laid down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. W.</hi> affirmed, The Light in every man to be a full Rule: And thus undertook to prove it:</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>If it he a ſpiritual Light, as wrought by the Spirit of God, then 'tis a full Rule: But I had acknowledged it thus a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do ſtill acknowledge that if its Denomination be taken from its Efficient, 'tis to be called ſpiritual; for 'tis the Spirit creates Reaſon in us. But 'tis improper to take a Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thence: Rather it ſhould be taken from its End and Uſe, and then, becauſe it reveals only Moral Duties, it would be properly termed Moral. But as to his Argument; I bid him prove his Conſequence; he bogles, and could make no work of it. Then I bid the people mind what pure Argument he brought: As though one ſhould ſay, If the ſtars were created by the Spirit of God, they are a full light, able to make it Day. The Scriptures are as the Sun, a full Light to guide us to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: The Light in every man, but as a Star, no full Light to travel by.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>If it convinceth of Sin. Righteouſneſs and Judgment, then 'tis a full Rule: But ſo it doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101119:12"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It convinceth not of Juſtifying Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> The active and paſſive Obedience of Chriſt; for it reveals not Chriſt at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> It doth reveal Chriſt. <hi>Proof</hi> 1. Rom. 2.14. <hi>If the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the Law, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may do things contained in the Law, and never know Chriſt. 'Tis not the Law, but the Goſpel that reveals Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proof</hi> 2. <hi>If the Grace of God that brings Salvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men, and teacheth to look for the appearance of our Saviour, then it revealeth Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Grace appears by the Goſpel where it comes; and the Goſpel teacheth to look for our Saviours appearance. Prove that the Light in every man reveals this Grace, or teacheth to look for the appearance of Chriſt. He adds, <hi>Proof.</hi> 3. p. 29. <hi>The Light was given to believe in before they were Believers:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it reveals Chriſt to Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Light which we are to believe in is Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and not that Principle of Knowledge that is in every man. And before we believe in Chriſt, even that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, he is revealed to us by the Goſpel, not by the Light that is in every man. <hi>Proof</hi> 4. <hi>Ibid.</hi> The Light ſhined in mens hearts before they did believe, to give them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it reveals Chriſt to all, even Unbelievers. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Read the place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>A.</hi> 1. Mark, 'Tis not ſaid <hi>(the Light)</hi> but <hi>(God)</hi> hath ſhined. 2. The true ſenſe is, God by the Goſpel propounding the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and by his Spirit enlightning the Eye, gives and encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt in his choſen; and thus firſt they become Believers, and afterward more and more are ſtrengthened in their Faith. And doth this prove that the Light in every man reveals Chriſt to all? to thoſe that have not the Goſpel? or that without the Goſpel it reveals Chriſt to any? <hi>(hath ſhined into our hearts)</hi> Had not they the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:101119:13"/>
               <p>Arg. 3. <hi>If the Light in every man be an increaſing Light,</hi> p. 28. <hi>doth gradually lead men out of Darkneſs and Sin, as men take heed unto it, though it reveals not all things at once,</hi> then 'tis a full Rule: But 'tis an increaſing Light; for 'tis ſaid, <hi>To every one of us is given Grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt gives ſuch a meaſure now; a greater after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And, <hi>p.</hi> 29. <hi>The path of the Juſt is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument, though not ſo well managed in the Diſpute, of any, had the greateſt ſhew of reaſon in it: But when it was Anſwered, that <hi>the Light in every man never grew up to make of it ſelf, and without the Scriptures, any diſcovery of Chriſt,</hi> all was daſht preſently. And there needs no more to be ſaid now. For though the uſe of Reaſon grows in a Child, and now it reveals Stealing unlawful, then Lying <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe firſt dimly, then more clearly; yet never attaining of it ſelf to reveal Chriſt, it muſt needs leave men in that dark ſtate in which Damnation is unavoidable: The Goſpel muſt deliver from this dark ſtate. The Light in every man cannot do it. If it were poſſible this Light could lead out of all Sin whatever, unable to reveal Chriſt, it muſt needs ſtill leave men in a ſtate of Damnation. The Grace that indifferent meaſures is given to Believers enjoying the Goſpel, as alſo the path of the Juſt who embrace Chriſt as revealed to them in the Goſpel, theſe put men into the ſtate of Salvation indeed; but they are one thing, the Light in every man another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It might be thus objected, If we obey what this Light can reveal according to the meaſure of it, God will accept us: <hi>For in every Nation he that worketh Righteouſnes is accepted of him.</hi> And what is not revealed doth not bind. <hi>p.</hi> 33. <hi>The Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>was not to make the Epiſtle of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>their Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Promulgation indeed is neceſſary to the Obligation of a Law; till therefore the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had knowledge of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were not bound to make it their Rule: But after knowledge, they were bound. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we ſhould obey this Light only, which in its higheſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101119:13"/>meaſure cannot reveal Chriſt, we ſhould not work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we might be accepted. For God having given us Scriptures, requires more of us than this Light reveals: And <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>p.</hi> 32. <hi>The Saints of old were according to their ſeveral attainments, to walk by the ſame Rule, and God would reveal to them,</hi> Ph. 3.16. Therefore this Light is a full Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Saints; what's that to every man? 2. They were to walk according to their ſeveral attainments: what they had got out of the Scriptures. By the ſame Rule, the Will of God laid down in the Scriptures, ſo far as they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it. What's this to thoſe that have not the Scriptures? What is it to the Light that is in every man?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God would reveal more to the Saints. But where is any promiſe that God will reveal Chriſt to every Heathen that walks according to his Light, though he never enjoyes the Scriptures or the Goſpel? Much leſs, where hath God ever promiſed that he will immediately by his Spirit reveal ſavingly all neceſſary Truths to them who in compariſon of a Light they have in common with the Heathen, deſpiſe the precious Scriptures? Chriſt is a Myſtery made manifeſt by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Prophets, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. But he that truſts to his own heart to make manifeſt Chriſt to him, is a Fool.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>P.</hi> 29. <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Propheſie, unto which ye do well to take heed, till the Day dawn, and the Day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Therefore by minding this Light within, by degrees it will reveal Chriſt to us. They draw not theſe Concluſions; but I am ſo far from hiding their ſtrength, as they have done mine, that I had rather improve their Arguments to the utmoſt for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Prove that by the Dawning of the Day, or the Day-ſtar ariſing in the Heart, is to be underſtood Chriſts firſt appearance in Grace unto their Souls. Had not Chriſt thus appeared to them already? were they not Believers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prove that by the Word of Propheſie is to be underſtood the Light in every man. Can this Light help every man to Propheſie? are all Prophets?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Word of Propheſie is the Scripture, in which are written the true Propheſies of God. Unto which we are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101119:14"/>as long as we live on Earth; even till the Day of Glory dawn, and the Day-ſtar, Chriſt Jeſus, after that we have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2 26.28. ariſeth in our hearts, taken in by Viſion, as now by Faith.</p>
               <p>Arg. 4. <hi>If the Spirit guides Believers into all Truth,</hi> p. 28. then the Light of this Spirit within muſt needs be a ſufficient (or full) Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not ſaid that the Light in every man guides into all truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it ſaid, that the Spirit guides every man, yea, or any man without the Scriptures, into all truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The true ſenſe is, That the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and enlightning the minds of Believers, ſhall lead them into all Truths neceſſary to Salvation. 'Tis weak to argue, Believers who enjoy the Spirit ſpeaking in the Scriptures, have a full Rule; therefore every man hath, even thoſe that enjoy neither the Spirit nor the Scriptures, but are left to the meer Light that is in every man to guide them.</p>
               <p>Thus it may be ſeen, that neither in the Diſpute, nor by the improvement of his Arguments then urged, nor by his Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Arguments, hath <hi>G. W.</hi> made good his Aſſertion, that the Light in every man is a full Rule.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now (becauſe I look on this point as the very Seat of the Controverſie) lay down what I urged, and might have been urged to prove, That the Light in every man is not a full Rule; and conſequently no Rule at all by it ſelf to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If God ſaw good that even in Innocency this Light which we bring with us into the world, ſhould not be mans full and whole Rule, nor after to <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor after to Chriſt's time, nor in Chriſt's time, nor in the Apoſtles days then there is little reaſon to fancy 'tis a full Rule now. But God ſaw good that even in Innocency this Light ſhould not be our full and whole Rule; for to this he added a Brohibition of eating the Tree of Knowledge, to be parts of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Rule; nor after to <hi>Moſes;</hi> for they were to offer Sacrifices, and be Circumciſed: Nor after to Chriſt; for the Ceremonial Law was part of their Rule: nor in Chriſts time; for he obſerved the Ceremonial Law, and alſo ſubmitted to Baptiſm: Nor in the Apoſtles days; for they upheld the Ordinance of Baptiſm and of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101119:14"/>Supper: None of all which things could this Light of it ſelf, and without ſupernatural Revelation, direct us to, as our Duty: and therefore neither may it be looked on now as our full or whole Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Touching Innocency, <hi>G. W.</hi> objected, <hi>Adam</hi> could diſcern by his Light within, he ought to abſtain from that Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> After and by the poſitive prohibition he was able to know it. But it was asked him, Could he have diſcerned it by the meer Light he brought with him into the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the poſitive Prohibition? He acknowledged, <hi>He could not.</hi> So, in the poſitive Inſtitution of Chriſt, it was replied; <hi>G. W.</hi> if he would not ſhut his Eyes, might by the Light within him, underſtand, that the Celebration of Baptiſm and the Supper, is the Churches Duty; though without thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions promulged, no man with all his Light is able to find it out. Here let it be taken notice, that he granted in effect, the whole Argument: For he granted, that before the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition came, his Light could not diſcover what was Gods pleaſure touching the Tree of Knowledge; and yet he yields, that God made abſtinence from this Tree his Duty: which is the whole contended for, And if even in Innocency, Mans perfect Light muſt not be the whole of his Rule; but to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his abſolute Dominion, and to maintain his juſt Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, would at his pleaſure, impoſe duty on man, over and above what his Light within could ſhew a reaſon for; what a miſerable Miſtake is it to imagine that now mans decayed Light ſhould, by Gods appointment, be the whole of that Rule we are to walk by? But though all was thus granted, and is very plain; yet troubled to ſee it go ſo ill with his Cauſe, he cavils, <hi>p.</hi> 30. much to this purpoſe; <hi>Was not God in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God is one thing, <hi>Adams</hi> Light another, created of God in him. God could reveal his pleaſure as he did by the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but <hi>Adams</hi> Light, without that Prohibition, could not ſhew <hi>Adam,</hi> what was Gods Pleaſure, as to this Tree; as himſelf hath acknowledged.</p>
               <p>He objects further, <hi>p.</hi> 30. mightily to the purpoſe <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were not</hi> Adams <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Draw the Concluſion. Therefore <hi>Adams</hi> Light, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101119:15"/>the prohibition, could diſcern that it was Gods pleaſure he ſhould not eat of the Tree of Knowledge. Theſe things hang cloſely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Abraham, Enoch, <hi>had a Rule before the Scriptures were written: the Pen-men alſo; directing them in writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Impertinencies ſeem to prove ſomething, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Point in hand. I therefore anſwer, 1. Though the Scriptures were not <hi>Adams</hi> Rule, becauſe then not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet to abſtain from the Tree of Knowledge, was part of his Rule in Innocency: To believe in the Seed of the Woman for breaking of the Serpents Head, was part of his Rule after the Fall; as alſo Sacrificing: Circumciſion part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Rule: All and every of which Duties, the Light in every man could by no means find out without Supernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. God was pleas'd to reveal theſe Duties immediately to ſelect perſons, as <hi>Adam, Abraham;</hi> and from them, by Tradition and Preaching, to communicate them to his Church in following Generations. And thus it appears, that before the Scriptures were written, the Light in every man was not his full Rule; but Gods will ſupernaturally revealed, and conveyed to poſterity by Tradition and Preaching part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But now it pleaſed our Gracious God ſupernaturally to reveal his whole Will touching his Churches duty to the end of the World, unto particular men, moving them by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to write (which motion was their Rule for that Action) the ſame, and commanding others to tranſcribe Copies; that ſo our guidance to Heaven might ſafely be conveyed to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; not loſt through neglect, nor forgotten through the ſlipperineſs of his peoples Memories; nor altered by relating it from mouth to mouth; nor corrupted by the Relation of it made ſometimes by wicked men. So that, as before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were written, Gods Will made known partly by the Light in every man, partly by Supernatural Revelation, and conueyed to poſterity by word of mouth, Tradition and Preaching, was the full Rule of the Church then living; ſo the ſame Will of God more clearly and brightly made known by Supernatural Revelation, and conveyed down to us moſt ſafely by the Holy Scriptures of the Prophets and others, is our full Rule, in which we are to triumph, as guiding us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to Glory and Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Touching the Ceremonial Law, he objects, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>As for thoſe Laws of Ceremonies and Shadows to the</hi> Jews, <hi>Salvation doth not depend upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is much to the purpoſe: The <hi>Query</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Laws were not part of their Rule before the death of Chriſt? and whether the Light in them, without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of thoſe Laws. could diſcover them? Though our Salvation doth not depend on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, yet had not the neglect of them before Chriſt's death, been ſin to a <hi>Jew?</hi> Had not the contempt of them then been the hazard of his Soul? Then it follows, that theſe Laws were part of their Rule, and that the Light within them, was not their full or whole Rule. The ſame is to be ſaid for the Supper and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in the Apoſtles days. Theſe were part of the Churches duty, yet the Light within, without the help of Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revelation, or the Inſtitution promulged could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Would theſe men prove that the Light within, without the help of Supernatural Revelation, can ſee Baptiſm and the Supper a Duty? Why then are they againſt it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the Light within?</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the help of Supernatural Revelation, even the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, our Reaſon can tell us, our Conſciences can convince us of our duty herein. And we dare not ſhut our eyes againſt the Truth, leſt we periſh for ever. But were it not for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, our Light within could ſay nothing here. To conclude, Since ſomething which the meer Light within could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, hath been the Duty of Gods people, from <hi>Adam</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, to the Apoſtles days, it followeth that in all that time, the Light within was not their full Rule: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Rule that comes ſhort of what the Church in the Apoſtles days went to Heaven by, cannot be a full Rule to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That which doth not reveal many duties which we are bound to perform, cannot be to us a full Rule, and ſafely bring us to Glory: A full Rule reveals all our duty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God would have his Church do, and is pleaſing to him.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101119:16"/>But this Light in every man doth not reveal many duties which we are bound to perform. We are bound to believe that the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Ghoſt God, and that theſe three are one God: But theſe are high myſterious Truths, which without Supernatural Revelation, the Light in every man can no way diſcover. We are bound to believe the Reſurrection of our Bodies, a fundamental Article of our Faith; but Reaſon cannot aſſure us of this: to ſeek for a new Birth; but meer Reaſon cannot apprehend this, nor the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of it, no more than whither the wind goeth: To pray that Gods Kingdom might come, his Spirit might govern within us, and cauſe us to bring forth fruit; hearing the Word; But this is a Myſtery, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.11, 20. We are bound, not to have the leaſt motion or inclination in our hearts to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God <hi>[Thou ſhalt not covet].</hi> Conſequently, to repent of any ſuch Motion; fly to Chriſts Blood for the pardon of it; but by the light within <hi>Paul</hi> had not known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> We are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent of our Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently fly to Chriſt for recovery; but laying aſide Scriptures, this light cannot reveal that <hi>Adams</hi> eating the fruit of a Tree ſhould be our Fall. We are bound to keep the firſt day of the week a Sabbath to the Lord, one day in ſeven we are enjoyned in the fourth Commandment, the ſeventh from the Creation is not now the day, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Let no man judge you in Meat or Drink, or in reſpect of a holy day, or the New Moon, or of the Sabbath days.</hi> It muſt then be one of the other ſix; and which doth the Scripture point out unto ſo much as the firſt? <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit on the Lords day. And the Diſciples met on the firſt day of the week to break Bread. The bare light in every man cannot ſhew this. We are bound to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Ordinance of Baptiſm: <hi>Go Baptize.</hi> The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Supper: <hi>Do this.</hi> By all this it appears this light cannot be a full Rule. As much duty as it can reveal, ought to be done: theſe things which it cannot reveal, ought not to be left undone. If we would ſafely get to Heaven, we muſt with <hi>Caleb.</hi> fully follow the Lord, obey him in all his Commandments, and not thoſe only this Light reveals. <hi>Herod</hi> could do many things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. My chief Argument is this; <hi>That which reveals not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101119:16"/>Chriſt, cannot poſſibly be a full Rule, or by it ſelf any Rule at all to Heaven. But the Light in every man, without Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revelation, can make no diſcovery of Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it cannot poſſibly be a full Rule, or by it ſelf be any Rule at all that can guide any to Salvation. The <hi>Major</hi> I prove; That that reveals not Chriſt, can of it ſelf be no Rule at all to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Two things will clear this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no Salvation but by Chriſt. God hath indeed <hi>exalted</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of Sins:</hi> But there is <hi>not Salvation in any other.</hi> Acts 4 12. <hi>For there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> John 14.6 <hi>No man cometh unto the Father but by me.</hi> As there is but <hi>one God,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. They that are <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> are <hi>without God, without hope,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no Intereſt in Chriſt without Knowledge and Faith in him. This is that which the promiſe of Chriſt and all his Benefits is made unto, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 22. <hi>That the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> This is the Condition of the Promiſe of purchaſed Salvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> How can any be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to obtain Intereſt in Chriſt, and Salvation purchaſed by him, that hath not the Qualifications to which Chriſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that comes not up to the Condition of the Promiſe? Again, whom God hath decreed to ſave, on them he doth infallibly beſtow Faith and the Knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> All that are to be ſaved, ſhall know Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught of God.</hi> That it is to know Chriſt, See <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God; every one therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Further, This work he hath committed unto Chriſt to beſtow the knowledge of himſelf on all that are to be ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 17.2, 3. <hi>Thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. And this is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Thoſe that are given to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101119:17"/>Chriſt, are all to be ſaved. Eternal Life is to be given to them all: and ſince this is eternal Life to know Chriſt, it follows that the knowledge of Chriſt is to be given to them every one. And this follows too, to whomſoever the knowledge of Chriſt is never given, to them eternal life is never given.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove; That the Light in every man reveals not Chriſt. Had not God ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, ond between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy Head.</hi> How could <hi>Adam</hi> with all the Light that was left him after the Fall, ever have underſtood, that it was the Gracious Deſign of God to ſave loſt man by a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the Seed of the Woman? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>What man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Hence it is that the whole Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called a Myſtery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentils, believed on in the World, received up to Glory.</hi> Chriſt's Love to his Church is a Myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.31, 32. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall be joyned unto his Wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Truth that bears any relation to Chriſt, is a Myſtery, precious, but ſecret, hid in God, that which the Light every man hath that comes into the world, could never find out, were it not for Supernatural Revelation. Yea, the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God, who greatly excel us in knowledge; the Church being ſupernaturally taught of God, have from it received Light to underſtand this Myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 10. <hi>To make all men ſee what is the Fellowſhip of the Myſtery which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world hath been hid in God: To the intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> The Light of every man cannot poſſibly give the knowledge of Chriſt: Only Chriſt himſelf can do this, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22. <hi>No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who is the Son but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> Where therefore the Goſpel comes not (for Chriſt reveals himſelf by the Goſpel) for all the Light men brought with them into the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101119:17"/>World, they have been there utterly deſtitute of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt call a Nation that thou knoweſt not, and Nations that know not thee, ſhall run unto thee.</hi> Yea, Chriſt hath not been ſo much as named amongſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20. <hi>I have ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, not where Chriſt was named.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. G. W.</hi> in a Book ſtiled, <hi>The Light and Life of Chriſt within,</hi> would prove, That <hi>this Light can reveal Chriſt,</hi> p. 46. becauſe it can reveal <hi>God.</hi> And Chriſt is God. If it be told him, that Chriſt is not our Saviour conſidered meerly. as God, but as God-man, that hath ſuffered for us: he objects, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. <hi>Before Abraham was I am.</hi> John 17.5. <hi>Glorifie thou me with the Glory I had with thee before the world was.</hi> He was before he took our Nature, and was he not a Saviour then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Let it be conſidered how Chriſt is our Saviour. He is our Saviour by purchaſing Forgiveneſs and Salvation for us by his Blood; and he is our Saviour by applying that purchaſe to us. This purchaſe is the Ground-work of our Salvation: Had there been no purchaſe, there had been no application of the things purchaſed. Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, Chriſt was our Saviour as God, who was to become man, and ſhed his Blood for us, to purchaſe our Pardon and Salvation; and ſo he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us what he was to purchaſe. Now he is our Saviour as God-man, that hath already purchaſed our pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by ſhedding his Blood for us. To prove that he is our Saviour conſidered meerly as God, is to prove, that he ſaves us, though he never did, nor ever was to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, and ſhed his Blood for us. Truly had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been deſigued to this, he had not been our Saviour any more than he is the Saviour of the Fallen Angels, whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was not to take on him. Thoſe therefore who before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, knew not Chriſt, as he was to be the Seed of the Woman, knew him not as the Saviour: And ſo now, thoſe that know not Chriſt as God in our Nature, who by his death hath purchaſed forgiveneſs and ſalvation for us, know him not as our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> He objects further, <hi>John</hi> 6.41. <hi>I am the Bread which came down from Heaven.</hi> Eph. 4.10. <hi>He that deſcended, is the ſame that aſcended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doth this prove that Chriſt is not our Saviour as

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101119:19"/>God-man, purchaſing forgiveneſs for us, ſuffering in our ſtead; but as God only? This rather confirms the contrary. For this was his main end in coming down from Heaven, that he might take our nature on him, and by dying purchaſe forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us, that having finiſhed this work, he might aſcend again. This proves him our Saviour as God-man.</p>
               <p>Obj. p. 70. <hi>His Divine Nature hath given us all things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.15. <hi>O God of Iſrael the Saviour.</hi> Theſe Scriptures prove him a Saviour as God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As his Man-hood concurs with his God head in applying his purchaſe to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi> Chap. 4.24. <hi>He was raiſed again for our Juſtification.</hi> Chap 8. 34. <hi>He lives for ever to make interceſſion for us.</hi> So his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head concurs with his Man hood in applying his purchaſe to us; and thus his Divine Power gives us all things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs. But this hath nothing in it to prove, that conſidered meerly as God, he is our Saviour; and that he never as God man, purchaſed Salvation for us, or that he applies ſalvation to us without any reſpect to his purchaſe; or that his manhood doth not at all concur in applying ſalvation to us; God is our Saviour, but in ſaving us he give us nothing but what is purchaſed. Let it be remembred, that ſince Chriſt as God-man did purchaſe our ſalvation, and ſtill his Manhood concurrs with his Godhead in applying it, Chriſt as God man is our Saviour, and not as God only. And to deny that Chriſt is our Saviour as God-man, is to contradict all promiſes and Prophecies concerning Chriſt as the Son of Man, the Seed of the Woman, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that a bone of him ſhall not be broken, that he ſhould be a man of ſorrows. In the old Teſtament. And to contradict the whole Hiſtory of the New; and indeed the whole Goſpel of Chriſt. What ſaith he of himſelf? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. <hi>I am the Root and Of-ſpring of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> As God the Root, as man the Of-ſpring. And what was his main deſign in taking our nature? Mind that Scripture, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament which is ſhed for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> His deſign was, by dying for us to purchaſe our pardon and conſequently ſalvation. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>God purchaſed the Church by his blood.</hi> This never could be, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his manhood. As God man then he is our Saviour.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101119:19"/>
               <p>It follows, If the light in every man can of it ſelf Reveal Chrſt as our Saviour; then it muſt without the help of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation, diſcover that the Son of God took our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on him; that he did dye for us; that he did purchaſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and ſalvation for us by his death. If it cannot Reveal theſe things it cannot reveal our Saviour; for by theſe things he is our Saviour. Let me a new propound my Argument. That that Reveals not Chriſt as God-man, that hath dyed for us, to purchaſe our forgiveneſs; cannot be a full Rule, cannot guide us to ſalvation. But this Light cannot ſo Reveal him. I prove the Major by that Scripture. <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;</hi> Except by a lively Contemplation of your humane nature aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into one perſon with my divine Nature, faith in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſprings, and is dayly nouriſhed and ſtrengthened and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in you. Your ſouls are not ſanctified, not reconciled to God and his wayes, you have no heart to ſerve God in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo as to be accepted of God and to live with him in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! You are dead in your ſins: If life Eternal be to know him as Jeſus Chriſt whom the Father ſent, <hi>John.</hi> 17.3. Then not to know him as Jeſus Chriſt whom the Father hath ſent, is to be deprived of Eternal life. The Jews therefore though they truſt in a promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yet not looking on him as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſent, they periſh. God hath now ſet him forth to be <hi>a propitiation through faith in his Blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. If we have have not faith in his blood then there is but little hope to have Gods wrath turned away from us. But the light in every Man, as hath been ſhewn, cannot of it ſelf reveal Chriſt at all, much leſs thus reveal him. We have a Maxim in Philoſophy, <hi>nil fit in intellectu quod non fuit prius in ſenſu.</hi> All our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge comes in by our ſenſes. And it holds good here, for as we in this age, could never have known that there was ſuch a man as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, were it not that we read and hear of him; ſo by the bare light in every man never could we attain to know that Chriſt was born, that he lived a ſinleſs life, that he ſuffered death; ſuffered for our ſins, by the appointment of the Father; and thereby obtained Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us; and that he roſe the third day, and is now removed up into glory. God doth not ordinarlly give us this knowledge any other way but by our ſenſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101119:20"/>
                  <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,</hi> This knowledge then comes not from our light within, but from our light without, <hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel, read or preached to us. The Concluſion, 1 hope, is now evident that this light in every man is no full Rule; nor by it ſelf, is it any Rule at all to Heaven.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Methinks Men ſhould dread to oppoſe ſo clear a truth by ſo deſperate a deduction, leaſt God condemn them for Blaſphemers of his Majeſty at the laſt day. A fallen creature without a Saviour cannot be ſaved, now is the blame to be laid on God that Devils are not ſaved, becauſe God provided not a Saviour for them? What a wicked and helliſh Poſition is this, (if God gives not every ſinner what is neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the blame is to be laid on God that he is not ſaved?) Without Regeneration no man can be ſaved; is the blame of every damned mans perdition to be laid on God, becauſe he did not Regenerate him? Is God thus a debter to ſinners? <hi>Who hath firſt given to him?</hi> By ſin all mankind hath forfeited ſalvation, God was not bound to provide for us a Saviour, any more then for the fallen Angels; therefore it cannot be he ſhould be bound to give the Goſpel to every one of us, though without this we ordinarily periſh. The Goſpel is Gods own,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101119:20"/>and may he not without blame do what he will with his own? give it to whom he pleaſe? and deny it to whom he pleaſe? Have not all men by ſin deſerved to be deprived of it, though ſome men more then others? If then we have it, let us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adore Gods grace vouchſafeing favour above deſert: If others go without; Let us commiſerate and pray for them, let us tremble at Gods wrath, through which their Land is darkned; let us juſtifie the moſt holy God, not dealing worſe with them then they have deſerved: Though, as hath been manifeſted without the Goſpel, the light in every man give not the leaſt knowledge of our Saviour; and ſo cannot of it ſelf giude us one ſtep towards Salvation. For no obedience is any ſtep in the way to Heaven, till it flowes from faith in Chriſts blood for Pardon and Reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I come now to my ſecond Aſſertion, to ſet forth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures worthineſs to be embraced as the chief and higheſt Rule. 'Tis this, <hi>That the will of God laid down in the Scriptures is our only Rule to Heaven and Salvation.</hi> I demanded of <hi>G. W.</hi> an Affirmation or denial, but could have neither. I read his promiſe to him and to all the people, and urged him to affirm or deny, but ſtill he refuſed. The writings abſtractively, ſaith he, that is the Ink and letters drawn upon the Paper, are not the only Rule, When my Aſſertion was, <hi>The will of God laid down in Scripture, is the only Rule to Salvation.</hi> This I preſt him ſtill to deny or affirm He would not, nor would he many others times ſignifie his affirmation or denyal to my Queſtions propounded, though he had made an agreement with me in Writing to do it; not being as good as his word, and making himſelf ſo often guilty of falſe-hood. The Lord give him to ſee the evil of it. When I ſaw I could get nothing out of him, I challenged him to deny his Aſſertion if he durſt. He ſtill ſtood off. Then I challenged all the reſt on the ſtage there, one by one, pointing to them ſingly, to deny it if they durſt. All mute.

And thus in effect it is acknowledged that they only are in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven who walk according to Gods will revealed in Scripture. And there is good reaſon for his grant. For if the Scriptures be a full Rule, revealing all; Gods will laid down there muſt needs be the only Rule. What can be more then all? No other

               <p>Can ſo much be ſaid for the Light that is in every man? that the Will of God revealed by it, is the only Rule that guides to Heaven. They would not in the Diſpute affirm this.

                     <item>5. That thoſe who will make this Light that every man hath, their only Rule, rejecting of Scripture in thoſe things this light cannot diſcover, are out of the way to glory and Salvation, are miſerable and to be pitied.</item>

               <p n="1">1. They are <hi>in themſelves,</hi> an infallible Rule. That is, 1. A Rule that cannot deceive us. 2. A Rule which if we practiſe, in all it requires of us, we cannot poſſibly miſs of Salvation. Three things neceſſarily concur to make a Rule thus Infallible. 1. It muſt reveal truth, for this only leads to heaven. 2. It muſt reveal nothing but truth, it muſt be incapable of revealing any error inſtead of truth, otherwiſe it may poſſibly deceive us, and we miſs of heaven. 3. It muſt reveal the whole truth, at leaſt all neceſſary to ſalvation; otherwiſe following it we may come ſhort of Heaven.</p>
               <p>That the Scriptures are in themſelves an Infallible Rule. I proved in the firſt diſpute (for there I then began.) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the man of God might be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> He fled from the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a rambling diſcourſe, but neither then, nor ſince in his book hath he anſwered it. Let the judicious read, p. 15. The proof here is clear: For, that reveals Truth to us, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Truth, all Truth neceſſary to ſalvation, muſt needs be in it ſelf an Infallible Rule to heaven. But the Scriptures reveal Truth; given by divine Inſpiration: Nothing but Truth, all Scripture is given; no part given by the ſuggeſtion of Satan; nothing dictated by a principle of darkneſs: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6 <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words.</hi> All Truth, able to furniſh to every good work. Therefore an Infallible Rule in themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101119:22"/>
               <p n="2">2. They are an Infallible Rule <hi>to us.</hi> That is, we can be ſure; or good and undeceiving grounds, that all dictates and directions out of the Scripture are from God, and ſufficient to guide us to ſalvation. The Miracles of the Pen-men, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the word working ſo good a change, on ſo many in all ages; The Innate Characters of divine Authority ſtamped on the word, as the Holineſs, Majeſty, Sublimity, and Truth of Prophecy; ſuffice abundantly to ſatisfie our hearts, they are from God; all from God. And ſatisfied in this; their own Teſtimony, their excelling fulneſs, compared with any other Rule what ever, and the Conſolation of our Spirits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Univerſal and ſincere obedience to God ſpeaking in them, give us ſweet aſſurance that they are a ſufficient guide to Salvation. From one of the Characters mentioned, the Truth of Prophecy; the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath full aſſurance that the Scriptures are a moſt ſafe Rule to walk by, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Nevertheleſs we have a more ſure word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take beed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can ſo much be ſaid for the dictates and directions of every mans heart? That they are an Infallible Rule to us? That as men may be ſure, that all directions out of the Scriptures are from God, ſo they can be ſure, on good &amp; undeceiving grounds, that all directions out of their hearts are from God. It will be ſaid, the compariſon is not rightly ſtated, it ſhould be, ſo all directions of the Light in every man are from God. To this I anſwer, So far as men make the Light within their Rule, they have nothing to walk by, but dictates or counſels out of their own hearts. Let but the Queſtion then be ſtated, as that it might meet with the concerns of men as to their practice, and it muſt be thus: I ſhall not therefore alter the ſtating of this Queſtion, though in the handling of it, I ſhall not wave that <hi>Query,</hi> whether all directions of the Light be infallibly from God?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Can it be ſaid that out of our hearts we are ſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no dictate or direction from darkneſs or error within, as we are ſure no directions out of ſcripture proceed from any ſuch principle? Not only in the Unregenerate is there darkneſs <hi>(ye were ſometimes darkneſs)</hi> but in the Regenerate alſo: The word of Prophecy ſhines in the hearts of believers, yet it ſhines there in a dark place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, 19. <hi>compared.</hi> And this darkneſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101119:23"/>abides whilſt on earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee in a Glaſs darkly.</hi> That <hi>(Now)</hi> is whilſt on Earth. 1. Becauſe oppoſed to <hi>(Then)</hi> which is after this Life is ended. 2. Becauſe it is as long as Faith, Hope, and Charity abideth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. And <hi>(Now) abideth, Faith, &amp;c.</hi> and that is whilſt we live on Earth, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and error within will be prompting amiſs.</p>
               <p>Have all Men that know the Scriptures as much reaſon to ſay, we are ſure no iuward Counſel that we have, proceeds from the ſuggeſtion of Satan; as to ſay no Scripture-Counſel is ſuggeſted by him? Within men are to be found many evil motions from Satan, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Try the ſpirits, for many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> The Devil is a buſie Agent; He filled the heart of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to lie to the Holy Ghoſt. He put it into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Theſe were unconverted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Are all Converts free from his Temptations? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Devil had acceſs to <hi>Adam,</hi> even in Innocency; to <hi>Peter:</hi> And why are Saints bid reſiſt him, ſtedfaſt in the Faith? And to put on the whole Armour of God? It is now impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men to go aſtray, walking after the Counſels, they find within, as it is impoſſible to go aſtray walking after the Counſels that are found in Scripture? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O young Man in thy youth, and walk in the waies of thy beart and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know, that for all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgement.</hi> If a man ſaith, <hi>I ſhall have peace though I walk after the imagination of mine own heart; the Lord will not ſpare, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man.</hi> Can this pleaſe God, that every man ſhould do <hi>what is right in his own eyes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Can it be ſaid that the Light in every man dictates in his heart the whole Truth, as much as is neceſſary to ſalvation? What though it ſhould be able infallibly to tells us, that we ought not to commit murther, or adultery, and direct us in ſome other few moral duties? Yet as long as it cannot infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, reveal all Truth neceſſary to ſalvation (for as hath been ſhewn, 'tis no full Rule) it cannot poſſibly be an infallible Rule to heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Can it be ſaid that every man hath an infallible Spirit of diſcerning the Counſels of this Light within him; from the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101119:23"/>Counſels of darkneſs, ſin and error within him, and of Satan that hath acceſs to him? If every man had ſuch a ſpirit, yet were not this Light to be preferred, becauſe it reveals but few truths in compariſon of the Scriptures. But the unconverted have not. p. 16. <hi>Paul miſtaken was unconverted.</hi> And ſaith our Saviour, <hi>They that kill you ſhall think they do God ſervice.</hi> They find no counſel in Scripture putting them upon this; therefore they muſt find it in their own hearts: 'Tis the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of darkneſs and error, yet taken for the Counſel of their Light; for they approve it and think it to be from God. They are not therefore infallibly guided in judging the counſels of their hearts. Nor have the converted this infallible ſpirit of diſcerning the dictates of Light within, from the dictates of Darkneſs. The young Prophet could not diſcern when the old one counſelled in the name of the Lord to come back and eat Bread, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.18. <hi>David</hi> thought he ſhould pleaſe God by bringing up the Ark though in a Cart: 'Twas by the Counſel of his own heart, not of the Scriptures. <hi>Nathan</hi> thought <hi>David</hi> might build God a Temple, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2, 3. Since no man hath an infallible Spirit of diſcerning between the Counſels of Light and Darkneſs in the heart, how can men ſay of every motion in their hearts, I am as ſure <hi>this is,</hi> and <hi>this is not</hi> from God, as they can ſay of all the Counſels in the Scripture, I am ſure theſe are from God? When men have their right ſenſe of what is counſelled in their hearts they may poſſibly take Error for Truth; When they have the right ſenſe of what is counſelled in Scripture, they cannot. We need no infallible Spirit to help to diſcern the Counſels of Light and Darkneſs in Scripture; for all <hi>there</hi> comes from God. To make the Counſels of the Scripture our Rule is ſafe. To make the Counſels of our hearts, dangerous. 'Tis the way to be led into a thouſand errors. <hi>A deceived heart hath turned them aſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. May it not be poſſible for the Light in every man to dictate ſome error for Truth, at leaſt through our fault, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it to ſpeak when it ſhould be ſilent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It might be objected, that I confeſſed it to be a Light wrought by the ſpirit of God in every man and how poſſibly can a Light of the Spirit of God direct amiſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Spirit the Creator, who ſpeaks in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101119:24"/>cannot poſſibly fall from his goodneſs, and dictate Error. But things created are in their nature mutable; may fall from their goodneſs, and dictate Error; as is to be ſeen in many of the Angels, and in our firſt Parents. Conſider <hi>Evahs</hi> Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was wrought by the Spirit of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Woman ſaw that the Tree was to be deſired to make one wiſe,</hi> (She ſaw) 'twas an act of her Judgement or that power of judging, which the ſpirit of God had, in perfection, created in her. (She ſaw that the Tree was to be deſired) 'twas falſe, She erred. Here you ſee what the Spirit of God reveals is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and falls from its goodneſs, and ſo dictates Error. And if <hi>Evahs</hi> Judgement failed her, may not our power of judging what is Gods will, what not, call it Light or what you will; fail us, though created by the ſpirit of God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Light that Gods ſpirit hath created in us, is now placed there where it meets with much Darkneſs and Vice to corrupt it: But a corrupt Judge will paſs a wrong ſentence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuting the Church acted according to his conſcience, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9. I verily thought with my ſelf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> The Scripture ſets forth Conſcience by thoughts, <hi>Ro.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their Conſcience bearing witneſs, and their thoughts mean while accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> Therefore <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence put him on to perſecute. The great <hi>Query</hi> is whether <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience did act <hi>according</hi> to <hi>Pauls</hi> Light, or <hi>againſt</hi> his Light, or <hi>according to his Darkneſs only,</hi> his Light ſtanding Neuter. Not <hi>againſt</hi> his Light; for <hi>Paul</hi> not having ſtudied the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſufficiently concerning Chriſt; not having attended to the Doctrine of Chriſt, preached by his Diſciples, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning Chriſt; the light he brought with him into the world, unable to reveal that there ſhould be a Chriſt, much leſs that this Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is he; he therefore had no Light concerning Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> for his Conſcience to act againſt, &amp; further, though a man may act againſt his own light, yet a mans Conſcience never acts againſt his Light: Hence is it, that when a man acts againſt his Light, he acts againſt his Conſcience alſo; this ever ſiding with his Light. If it ſhould be ſaid <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience acted <hi>according to his darkneſs only,</hi> his Light ſtanding Neuter; I ask, what Light was that that ſtood
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101119:24"/>Neuter? Any Light able <hi>then</hi> to reveal <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the Chriſt? Since he had no ſuch Light, no ſuch Light could ſtand Neuter. Let it be conſidered, God ſets up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in man to act according to the beſt preſent Light in him. This cannot be denied. Hence, when Conſcience hath not ſatisfying light to act by, it is doubtful, and refuſeth to encourage to act: when it hath light diſcovering ſuch an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to Gods Will, it reſtrains from doing it; if it be done, it accuſeth, condemneth: When it hath light repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſuch an action pleaſing to God, it puts on to do it, excuſeth, approveth a man for doing it. And doth it with any confidence encourage to do a thing, unleſs a mans beſt preſent light be poſitively for it. Since <hi>Pauls</hi> Conſcience did poſitively put him on to perſecute the Church, and this with all confidence <hi>(I thought verily)</hi> I conclude <hi>Pauls</hi> Light ſtood not Neuter; but <hi>his preſent Light,</hi> his <hi>beſt</hi> preſent light, <hi>all</hi> his beſt preſent light was <hi>poſitively</hi> for perſecuting the Church of Chriſt. Now judge whether this light within may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate Sin for Duty, Errour for Truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is poſſible for darkneſs to prompt Errour in ſtead of Truth: But this Light which the Spirit of God hath created in every man is darkneſs: Therefore it is poſſible, nay very eaſie, for this Light to prompt Errour, and hard in ſome caſes to do otherwiſe. That it is darkneſs I prove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.23. <hi>If thine Eye be evil, thy whole Body is full of darkneſs.</hi> Some peoples eyes are evil, and if their whole bodies be full of darkneſs, it follows, that there no true Light at all in them; the Light that is, is real darkneſs. It therefore is added, <hi>If the Light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> Luke 11.35. <hi>Take heed that the Light, which is in thee be not darkneſs.</hi> If there were <hi>no danger</hi> that a mans Light ſhould be darkneſs, what room were there for this warning; It is therefore uudeniable that there is a Light in man which is but darkneſs. And I ask, what Light is that? Not Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Saints; not his holy Spirit that dwelleth in them; not the Light of the Goſpel taken in by Faith; not the ſpecial illumination of the Holy Ghoſt. Tell us then, what Light can it be, but the Light we brought with us into the world; the Light that is in every man? He that hath no more but this Light, is all Darkneſs; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5, 8. <hi>Ye
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101119:25"/>were ſometimes Darkneſs:</hi> All darkneſs: Ye had then not one Drachm of Light in you: the Light you had, was but Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how can this be? If it be Light, 'tis Light; how can it be, and not be the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It can of it ſelf without Scripture, teach <hi>Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> that God is to be worſhipped, Parents obeyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been hinted often; and in <hi>this reſpect</hi> 'tis Light. But it cannot reveal <hi>Chriſt</hi> of it ſelf. When he is <hi>revealed</hi> by the Striptures and preaching of the Goſpel, it cannot diſcern him, nor any other ſpiritual Myſtery of the Goſpel, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned, the Natural man with all his Light cannot reach to this. And in theſe two reſpects 'tis meer darkneſs; no more able to guide a man to Salvation than dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> We may not put Light for Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When Chriſt evidently hints, the Light within may be darkneſs, muſt he be thus reproved, <hi>You may not put Light for Darkneſs?</hi> That which <hi>in reſpect of Morals</hi> is Light, he calls Light; and the ſame, being <hi>in reſpect of Spirituals,</hi> real Darkneſs, he properly calls it ſo. He doth not therefore put Light for Darkneſs: And <hi>G. W.</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>Div. of Chriſt,</hi> in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Dawſon,</hi> p. 42. <hi>That the Natural man bath not power to diſcern ſpiritual things.</hi> Is not his Light darkneſs then? What he adds, <hi>yet he hath a power to receive them;</hi> is very odd: For how do men receive ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things into their Souls, but firſt by diſcerning them, then approving and embracing them? His Reaſon is miſerable; <hi>for after Converſion, he doth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>receive them.</hi> He might as well have ſaid, the Unconverted hath power to receive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things; for after Converſion he doth diſcern them. 'Tis as if he ſhould have ſaid, When <hi>Sampſon</hi> was an Infant he had power to carry the Gates of a City up the Hill; for when he was a man he did it. In Converſion we receive a new Light, and a new Heart, which is a new power to receive ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p>This Light that is wrought in us by the Spirit of God, when put upon it, to direct us how to obtain Pardon and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bids us ſeek it by the works of the Law, never pointing to Chriſt: therefore, at leaſt being forced to ſpeak through
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101119:25"/>our fault, where it ſhould be ſilent, as being unable to direct herein, it both can and doth miſguide. It will be yielded in terms I think, that there is no Pardon or Juſtification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in Chriſt. And it hath been proved, that this light of it ſelf cannot ſpeak one Syllable of Chriſt, therefore it cannot tell us how to obtain Pardon and Juſtification. If then we will force it to ſpeak in this point, it muſt needs ſpeak Falſhood, if any thing. See it thus directing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>The doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified; for when the Gintiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law to themſelves.</hi> The Apoſtle lays down the way of Juſtification by the Law of works. <hi>[The Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified]</hi> He proves it; for the Light of Nature puts the Gentiles upon doing of the works of the Law, that they may be juſtified; having no knowledge of the Law of Grace, which direct to Chriſt by Faith for Juſtification, they walk by the Law of works; which is no way to Heaven for a fallen Creature. The like we may ſee in ſeveral of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> Rom. 9.32. <hi>They ſought for Righteouſneſs, not by Faith, but by the works of the Law.</hi> And that the Light within them, did put them upon this, we may ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 10.2. <hi>I bear them Record that they have a zeal of God.</hi> This they did then in a <hi>zeal</hi> for God, deſigning his Glory, and to do his will. But never doth a man any thing in zeal to Gods glory, but when his Reaſon, his Judgment, his Conſcience, his beſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the beſt Light he hath, puts him on: And that this is not the way to obtain Juſtification, is evident, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.32. The works of the Law are called <hi>a ſtumbling Stone.</hi> It is a truth indeed that the <hi>Doers</hi> of the Law ſhall be juſtified: but no man can poſſibly be a <hi>Doer.</hi> He that hath <hi>once,</hi> in thought, word or deed, in all his life broken the Law, is not a <hi>Doer</hi> of the Law, but a <hi>Tranſgreſſor;</hi> therefore this is no way for our Juſtification, becauſe in our hearts are motions of darkneſs and errour; becauſe Satan hath acceſs to inſinuate evil into us; becauſe the Light we brought into the world doth not reveal all neceſſary Truths; becauſe we have not an infallible Spirit to diſcern theſe few Truths it doth reveal, from Errours ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in our hearts; and becauſe 'tis poſſible for this very light it ſelf to ſuggeſt errour, we are not ſure upon good
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101119:26"/>grounds that all Counſels out of our hearts are from God; as werare ſure all Counſels out of the Scriptures are from God. No can we ſo ſafely walk after Counſels out of our own hearts (for the Counſels of the light within come out of our own hearts) as we can ſafely walk after Counſels out of the Scripture. Theſe are infallible to us, the other not.</p>
               <p>Before I end, I muſt anſwer what he brings to prove this Light an infallible Rule.</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 17. <hi>l.</hi> ult. <hi>Chriſt. bids us believe in the Light.</hi> He would not have us believe in that that might deceive us.</p>

'Tis not, Believe in the Light you brought with you into the World. Nor was this to be taken from them. Not believing in Chriſt, they were to cary this to Hell with them to torment them for their Sin.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>The Scripture is not to be preferred before the Spirit.</hi> p. 13. <hi>The Spirit is greater than the Scripture.</hi> p. 17. And <hi>you did acknowledge the Spirit revealed as certainly the mind of God as the Scripture,</hi> ib.</p>

Though the Counſels of Gods Spirit in Believers hearts be <hi>in themſelves,</hi> as certainly the Truths of God (and the Spirit is not to be quenched) as are his Counſels in the Scriptures; for he can never lie: Yet are they not to <hi>Believers</hi> ſo certainly the Truths of God. Believers are not at all times ſo readily <hi>certain, they</hi> are indeed the Counſels of the Spirit, as they are <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are. <hi>We have a more ſure word of Propheſie.</hi> More ſure than what? Not only than the Counſels we find in our hearts, not only than the Counſels of the Light within us; but more ſure than the direction or Voice of God himſelf ſpeaking to us, immediately, or not by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>There came a voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my Beloved Son.</hi> v. 18. <hi>This Voice we heard.</hi> v. 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of Propheſie.</hi> The <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> containing the Propheſies of Chriſt, are <hi>to us</hi> a more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101119:26"/>ſure Rule than the <hi>immediate voice of God</hi> himſelf; though in it ſelf what God immediately ſpeaks, is as certainly truth as what is ſpoken in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. The Controverſie being about a <hi>Rule,</hi> the Spirit ſhould not be oppoſed to the Scriptures. For the Spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is no Rule at all. The Spirit enditing and ſpeaking in the Scriptures, is not the <hi>Rule,</hi> but the <hi>Authr of the Rule.</hi> The Spirit bringing Scripture to remembrance, even what Chriſt hath ſpoken, and thereby directing us, is not our Rule, but puts us in remembrance of the Rule. The Spirit enlightning us to underſtand Gods mind in the Scripture, is not our Rule, but our ſpiritual Oculiſt ſtrengthning our Eyes to ſee the Rule. Nor is the Illumination of the Spirit a Rule at all (as he often ſuppoſeth) the Artificers Rule is one thing, the clearneſs of his Eye, to ſee the Rule, another: for our rule to Heaven is one thing, the clearneſs of our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, given by Gods Spirit to diſcern the rule, another: The Rule objectively ſets Gods Will and our Duty before us; the Spirits illumination brightens our Underſtanding to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it ſo ſet before us. And if the Spirit be not a Rule, much leſs is he a greater Rule than the Scriptures: He ſhould thus have expreſſed himſelf to ſpeak to the Point; <hi>The Dictates, or Counſels, or Directions of the Spirit of God immediately, and without the Scriptures, are to all men a more infallible Rule to Heaven, than the Directions of the Spirit of God in the Scriptures are to thoſe that have them.</hi> And if he had well proved this, he had manifeſted, that there is ſome foundation for his Religion. But neither can he, nor all his Brethren prove, that Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth without the Scripture reveal to every man the whole mind of God, as much as is neceſſary to bring him to Heaven. God ſpake immediately to <hi>Moſes:</hi> Did he <hi>then</hi> thus reveal to every man as much as to him? Doth he <hi>now? Are all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets?</hi> If he ſhould vouchſafe to reveal a little to any of his, and not by the Scripture; they have alſo a more ſure word of Propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſince he doth not reveal to any without the Scriptures, all neceſſary Truths as he doth by it; to deſire and prefer the Spirit teaching without the Scriptures, before the Spirit teaching by the Scriptures, as a more infallible guide to Heaven; is to deſire, and prefer what God denies us, before that which God vouchſafes us; to hanker with <hi>Evah</hi> after the denied fruit; to diſlike with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:101119:27"/>that came from Heaven. We muſt not frowardly preſcibe to God; <hi>the Spirit immediately teaching ſhall be my Guide to Glory; the Spirit teaching in the Scriptures ſhall not.</hi> We ought thankfully, and admiring his Grace, accept of that Guide to Glory, he chuſeth for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I aſſert, The Scripture is a <hi>Trying Rule:</hi> That is, a <hi>Rule able to prove or manifeſt Truth to be Truth, Falſhood to be Falſhood, in all things that concern our Faith and Converſation.</hi> A Rule by which we may, and ought, when we have any reaſon of doubting, to try for our own ſafety, Opinions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Spirits, whether they are of God or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which diſcovers the whole Truth, is able to try every Opinion, Doctrine and Spirit: But the Scriptures are a full Rule, diſcovering the whole Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. By that which we know to be infallible, we may and ought to try what is doubtful: But we know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are an infallible Rule: Therefore by them we may, and ought to try, whatever, as to Faith and Converſation we doubt of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. When the Apoſtles had ſaid, <hi>We have a moreſure word of Propheſie,</hi> he adds, <hi>unto which ye do well to attend:</hi> He means for trial and proof of Truth.

That which the Holy Ghoſt approves of, is our duty, and for our good: But he approves of it, that we try Doctrines; yea, the Doctrines of the Spirit of God, by the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe of Theſſalonica, in that they ſearched daily whether theſe things were ſo.</hi> This Argument was fled from in the firſt Diſpute, and neither <hi>then</hi> nor <hi>ſince</hi> anſwered in their Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. What Rule Chriſt directs us to try by, himſelf, his Apoſtles alſo made uſe of for this purpoſe; is our ſafe, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule.

He

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. We may ſafely embrace what agrees with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for what agrees with Truth, is Truth: We may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject all that is contrary to Scripture; for what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Truth is Errour: Yea, we may ſafely reject, as to Faith and Converſation, what is beſide the Scripture; for what is more than our full Rule, is more than what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is vain; <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine, the Traditions of men.</hi> Col. 2.18. <hi>Beware leſt any ſpoil you through Philoſophy or vain deceit after the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, after the Rudiments of the world, and not after Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the Scriptures are a ſafe trying Rule.</p>

Looking within, all that we can ſee, when we are in doubt of a thing, is a Dictate, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Conſideration for it, and another againſt it: Now we are to ſee, and need another Rule to try which of theſe comes from our Light, which from our Darkneſs.

And we know what Chriſt calls darkneſs. The ſenſe then is this; Goſpel-light ſhines now more than before (and at this day in the Holy Scriptures) but men follow the dictates of their dark Underſtandin, their Light within, even their own apprehenſions, rejecting Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-light.

The Scriptures did bind in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and after to Chriſts, and in the Apoſtles time, even ſpeaking of things which this Light without extraordinary Revelation cannot diſcover. And if ſo, ſtill. To deny that the Scripture did in theſe things then bind, is to ſay it had been no ſin for the Jews before Chriſt death. To reject the whole Ceremonial Law; or for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to reject the Apoſtles directions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords Supper.</p>

If the Scripture doth not bind us in ſuch things, it will follow we are not bound to believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are all three one and the ſame God; or that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the body; that we are not bound to keep the firſt day of the week a Sabbath to the Lord; nor to ſeek for Regeneration; nor to repent of our Fall in <hi>Adam;</hi> nor mourn for our corruption of Nature, or for any firſt motions to ſin; that we are not to be Baptized, or Receive the Lords Supper; no nor believe in Chriſt at all for juſtification, nor to embrace the Goſpel; conſequently that the contrary is no ſin; for this Light of it ſelf without ſupernatural Revelation teacheth us none of theſe things.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Gods commands cannot want Authority, muſt therefore needs bind us, even in thoſe things this light cannot teach. But the Scriptures contein ſuch commands. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. This is his command that we believe in his Son, do this in remembrance of me.

If we are to be ſaved in obeying Chriſt fully, that is, in things this light ſpeaks nothing of, as well as in other things to be damned, not obeying Chriſt in thoſe things this light doth not of it ſelf require; then in theſe things the Scriptures do certainly bind us. But the former is true, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the wicked will turn and keep all my ſtatutes he ſhall ſurely live,</hi> not only do <hi>what the Light in every man teacheth;</hi> but <hi>all my Statutes. Heb.</hi> 5.9.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101119:29"/>on them that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Goſpel ſtill preſcribes things above what this light can of it ſelf reaveal or reach. The Lord God awaken theſe men. How fearful is it to reject the Scriptures, as not binding in thoſe things this Light cannot teach us?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we muſt not do any thing becauſe we ſee it written in the Scripture but muſt obey the ſpirit of God moving in our hearts within.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ſpirit dwelling in all believers, is ſometimes a ſweet mover to duty, though no indwelling ſpirit, yet by common convictions, he ſtrives with unbelievers who do reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt: The duty he puts men upon is agreeable to the Scripture, and his motions are not to be quenched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The things commanded in the Scripture are to be done, whether the ſpirit inwardly puts men forwards or no, Look over theſe Four laſt Arguments againe. Otherwiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſpirit never putting forward within, it had been no ſin for the Jews before Chriſts time to reject all the Ceremonial Law, nor for us to omit all thoſe duties hinted in the Second Argument. Gods commands ceaſe not to be Gods commands, either becauſe the ſpirit doth not within put men on to obey them, or becauſe they are written; therefore we are to obey them though the ſpirit within puts not on. And this is to obey the ſpirit, or to obey God. Therefore according to the Fourch Argument, Though men ſhould ſay the ſpirit did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inwardly put them on, they are certainly to be damned who obey not the voice of God in Scripture. And to theſe I adde this Fifth Argument. Otherwiſe ſome wicked men in living contrary to the Scriptures do not ſin, cannot be damned for ſo doing, for ſome have ſinned away the motions and ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods ſpirit, are paſt feeling, given up to reprobate ſenſe. 6.

Be careful for nothing, but in every thing let your requeſts be made known to God,)</hi> becauſe I find theſe ſweet commands in Gods book, I will with Gods help take heart and fall to pray. I appeal to any mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether I do not well in ſo doing. This Induction might paſs for the Firſt Argument, and the Second is this. For ſeeing a thing written in Scripture, I am the more ſure it is the mind and Will of God, all Scripture being by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, therefore I thought for this very reſon the rather perform it becauſe I find it written. <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. And why doth God command us to read, but that we ſhould obey? <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. <hi>The King ſhall read in the book of the Law, all the dayes of his Life that he might learn to keep all words of this Law to do them.</hi> The end of our very reading muſt be practice. A 4th. <hi>Arg.</hi> from Examples, ſee in the cloſe of the Letter that follows The Scripture binds, and that in thoſe things of which the Light in every man, by it ſelf ſaith nothing. And dares any man ſay that this Light doth bind the Church of God, in thoſe things the Scriptures do not teach? Let no man be <hi>wiſe above what is written.</hi> And now let the Reader judge, which is the higheſt and ſafeſt Rule to Heaven; the Scriptures or the Light in every man. Gods will laid down in Scripture is a full, only, infallible, trying, binding Rule to Heaven, and that in thoſe things of which this Light ſaith nothing. Gods will, ſo much of it as is diſcovered by this Light, is no Rule at all to heaven, becauſe no full Rule; not the only Rule, hardly diſtinguiſhable from the dictates of darkneſs, Sin and Satan; inſufficient to try all Doctrines by; not at all binding the Church in thoſe things the Scriptures do not teach.</p>

How unconceivably miſerable it is to be deceived! It is our ſafety, our great wiſdom to walk by ſuch a Rule as cannot deceive us. Scripture-Counſel is full, and all by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration: Walk ſincerely according to this Rule, thou canſt not erre, thou canſt not be damned. If all the dictates of Light within were infallibly the Truths of God, yet heart. Counſels are ſome of them from Darkneſs and the Devil; walk after theſe though never ſo warily, thou maiſt poſſibly erre, poſſibly thou maiſt loſe thy Soul. To ſay, I will forſake all the Counſels of darkneſs that are within me, and walk on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Counſels of the Light within me; is, as if thou ſhouldſt ſay, here is a Cup of Wine mixed with poyſon, I will drink out only the wine, and leave the poyſon. Friend, the Scriptures are a Cup of pure wine; no Counſels of Sin, Errour, Darkneſs, Devils, mingling with the Counſels of God: Is it not ſafer drinking there?</item>

               <head>Whether every man be enlightned with a ſaving Light?</head>
               <p>SO much having been ſpoken by me, and granted by the Adverſary, touching this Light, compared with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; I did deſervedly explode this Queſtion out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Diſpute; where I had but little time left for diſcuſſing the following Queſtions. Yet now I muſt not decline it.</p>
               <p>Upon two accounts may a Light properly be denominated Saving.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If it reveals <hi>objectively</hi> all Truths to us neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This may be called ſaving, becauſe <hi>if we obey it in all things,</hi> we ſhall certainly be ſaved. Thus the Scriptures, or the Goſpel contained in them, are an <hi>external</hi> ſaving Light: External, I ſay, becauſe it muſt have entrance by our Senſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation.</hi> Eph. 1.13. <hi>The Goſpel of Salvation.</hi> Acts 11.14. <hi>Words by which we may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. If it enlightens our Underſtanding <hi>effectually</hi> to apprehend all Truths neceſſary to Salvation ſo revealed. This may well be called ſaving, becauſe <hi>it puts us actually into a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and infallibly brings us to Heaven.</hi> Thus the ſpecial Illumination of the Spirit in Believers, is an internal ſaving Light, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> I ſay, the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Illumination; for there is a <hi>common</hi> Illumination, not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: It cauſeth to receive the Seed with joy; to taſte of the heavenly gift, and of the powers of the world to come; but it doth not effectually prevail with the whole Soul to prize above life, and ſo entertain, and ſtedfaſtly cleave to the truths and ways of God. This premiſed;</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. I affirm, that the Light in every man is not in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe ſaving. It doth not enlighten any mans Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101119:31"/>effectally to apprehend all Truths neceſſary to Salvation, though they ſhould be revealed before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. What God gives not, man hath not; <hi>a man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing except it be given him from above.</hi> But God doth not give to every man a ſavingly enlightned underſtanding. Therefore every man hath it not. I proved that God gives it not to every man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The Lord hath not given you eyes to ſee to this day.</hi> This was urged the firſt Diſpute. <hi>G. W.</hi> p. 19. <hi>They did ſee,</hi> v. 2. <hi>You have ſeen all the Lord did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What are we to underſtand by <hi>Eyes not given?</hi> Not an underſtanding <hi>enlightned only with that Light that every man hath;</hi> for with this they ſaw all the Lord did: therefore an underſtanding <hi>effectually and ſavingly enlightned.</hi> This had not been given them to that day.</p>
               <p>He objects, They did cloſe their eyes, therefore God did not enlighten them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was impoſſible they ſhould cloſe the Eyes of an effectually, ſavingly enlightned underſtanding; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had ſuch eyes to cloſe. All men then have not a ſaving Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Darkneſs cannot ſavingly enlighten. The Light in every man is darkneſs, as hath been already proved. And who puts darkneſs for light, if not he that puts the dim light of every man for an effectual and ſaving Illumination?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. A ſaving Light breaks the heart for ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.61, 62. <hi>The Lord turned and looked on Peter; and Peter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the words of the Lord, and he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> Changeth the heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>All we beholding as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory.</hi> Giveth Soul ſatisfaction in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15, 16. <hi>Bleſſed are they that know the joyful ſound; they ſhall walk O Lord, in the Light of thy Countenance; in thy Name ſhall they rejoice.</hi> Cauſeth the Soul to come to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.</hi> And engageth the heart to Obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.102. <hi>I have not departed from thy Judgments, for thou haſt taught me.</hi> 1 John 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith he knoweth him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar.</hi> But all men have not their hearts broken, changed, ſatisfied in God, cloſing with Chriſt, and Gods ways: Therefore every mans Light is not ſaving.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101119:31"/>How can that be called effectual, which doth not effect theſe things? And if it doth not effect theſe things, it never ſayes. And how can that be called ſaving, which never ſaves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> p. 18. <hi>Many rebel againſt, grieve, reſiſt the Spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are given up to hardneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if they had had an effectual ſaving Light, they had not rebelled againſt, grieved and reſiſted the Spirit, their hearts had been changed, they had cloſed with Chriſt and his wayes. This very Rebellion proves they never had a ſaving Light.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Man is not a Block or a Beaſt, that ſaving Light inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and irreſiſtably ſhould force a change upon a Rebel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, no, but it doth infallibly, irreſiſtably, <hi>in a moſt ſweet manner,</hi> turn, change, and win and prevail upon him to cloſe with Chriſt and his Commandments. <hi>Saul</hi> was a Rebel, but when it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Immediately he conſulted not with fleſh and blood.</hi> And there is 10: one taught of the Father, but comes to Chriſt. Not a Soul that knows God, but he keeps his Commandments, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other ſheep I have, which I muſt bring.</hi> Then they <hi>muſt</hi> come, and cannot ſtay back; ſo irreſiſtably by Love doth Chriſt win them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If a <hi>greater</hi> by far, and a <hi>higher</hi> Light be not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ſo ſaving, much leſs is this Light that is in every man, ſaving. But as hath been hinted, there is a common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit, that goes along with the Preaching of the Goſplel; yet not effectual. This, having the advantage of the Goſpel, can help a man to ſo far more than the dim light of Heathens can either reveal or diſcern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. That Light that leaves men in a natural eſtate, can never ſave: For he that is in his natural eſtate, is a Child of wrath. But this Light within leaves all the ungodly in their natural eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. That Light which cannot help a man to underſtand Spiritually the things of God, can much leſs effectually win him to embrace and live to Chriſt, that he might be ſaved. But this Light, though it can help to underſtand literally, yet not ſpiritually, the things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. with all his Light, the natural man cannot know them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. That which leaves men under a diſability of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101119:32"/>to Chriſt, of breaking off their ſins, of obeying the Law of God, is far from ſaving: But this Light leaves men under a diſability of coming off from their ſins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin? then may you who are accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> Their Light could not deliver them from Impemtency. A diſability of coming to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me except the Father draw him.</hi> Without drawing by a ſpecial Illumination, for all his Light, he is left under an impoſſibility of coming, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.7. <hi>The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.</hi> All his Light cannot reſcue him from an impoſſibility of obedience. Can ſuch a Light ſave?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. If this Light could be effectual to mans Salvation, then the ſpecial illuminations of the Spirit given, or promiſed, would be needleſs, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Spirit ſhall convince of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſa. 54.13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 24.7. <hi>I will give them an heart to know me.</hi> But God doth nothing in vain: therefore every man is not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a ſaving Light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I affirm, that the Light in every man is not in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe ſaving. It doth not <hi>objectively</hi> reveal all Truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. This is already abundantly proved, when I proved this Light no full Rule. To all there, I ſhall here only add,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the natural man with all his Light, cannot ſo much as underſtand thoſe ſpiritual Truths which are neceſſary to ſalvation, when they are by the Goſpel or Scripture objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed unto him, 'tis but a wild fancy to imagine, that this Light can, without the Goſpel and Scripture, find out, and objectively reveal theſe ſpiritual Truths. But when they are objectively revealed, he cannot know them. He, who when he is plainly ſhewn, is not apprehenſive of the Myſtery of a Trade, would never take it of his own head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If this Light can objectively reveal all Truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation; then there was no need that God ſhould inſpire holy men to write the Scripture. Men might have done well enough without them; are little or nothing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by them. The Heathen, for a Rule, are in as good a condition as we. The Scripture reveals all Truth neceſſary to ſalvation, and their Light can do this. But God was not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101119:32"/>about a needleſs work, when he inſpired the Penmen of the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage hath the Jew? Much every way: chiefly, becauſe that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> The Heathen without the Covenants of promiſe are without hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Therefore this Light doth not objectively reveal all Truths neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what Arguments <hi>G. W.</hi> hath to prove that every man is enlightned with a ſaving Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. p. 28. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.20, 26. <hi>Thou gaveſt them alſo thy good Spirit to inſtruct them, nevertheleſs they rebelled. Therefore all are ſavingly enlightned.</hi> To this our Oppoſer gave no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No wonder; when it was never urged in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a ſaving external light, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God <hi>ſpeaking in the Scriptures and in the Prophets.</hi> What's this to prove, that thoſe who have not the Scriptures, have ſoch a Light?</p>
               <p>Again, The Spirit was given to inſtruct them, but not by any effectual Illumination, otherwiſe they had not been rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious. Their Rebellion proves they had no internal ſaving Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. p. 26. <hi>The Spirit or Light of God is greater or more univerſal than the Scripture, and contains that which the Scripture contains, and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe bare Aſſertions without Proof, deſerve to be rejected without Anſwer. And here he confounds Light and Spirit. The Light is Univerſal in reſpect of the Subject, they have it that have not the Scripture, not in reſpect of the Object; it reveals not all the mind of God, as doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <hi>Query</hi> is not, what the Spirit of God <hi>can</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, he <hi>can,</hi> no doubt, reveal all, and add to the Scripture if he pleaſe: But whether he <hi>actually doth</hi> reveal all ſaving Truths to all Men without the Scripture. This ſhould be proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. p. 10. <hi>Will you deny immediate Revelation, that the people might pin their faith on your ſleeve?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This man knows we direct people to the Revelation of the ſpirit in the Scripture, therefore his own light here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him. If I could find out any better arguments of his,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101119:33"/>I would produce them. But take them, ſuch as they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. p. 17. <hi>Chriſt is given to be a Light to the Gentiles, and Gods ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſo Chriſt is externally by the Scriptures and Goſpel preached, and internally by his ſpirit effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning; both wayes, a ſaving Light to all the Gentiles that are ſaved. Here's nothing to prove that every man is effectually enlightned, or externally taught all neceſſary truths, by Chriſt immediatly and without the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg</hi> 5. p. 31. <hi>Whatſoever may be known of God, is not manifeſt within?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>

                  </gap> That which is commonly known, his external power and God head; Not his grace, favour and mercy in Chriſt, without which all other knowledge is in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. It might be argued, If Heathens have not the knowledge of truths neceſſary to ſalvation, how are they left without excuſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God is not bound to reveal Chriſt to every man, and what Truths are revealed, every man ſins againſt them; And they are condemned, not for not believing in Chriſt, but for thoſe ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>They that have ſinned without Law, ſhall periſh without Law.</hi> And if their acting cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their ſhallow Light ſhall render them inexcuſable. How great will his condemnation be, that caſts off the ſaving Light of Scripture, and will walk only after ſuch dim Light as is in Heathens? <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs, more than Light.</hi> They cannot ſay we never heard that Chriſt ſhed his blood for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, if we had, we would have believed. But this argument might be farther improved, thus. If their living contrary, to their Light renders them without excuſe, then if they had lived up to their Light, they had been ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is but a frivolous ſuppoſition, for none ever did, none ever could live up to their Light; that is, from the beginning of their knowledge, to the end of their dayes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly do every thing they know to be their duty. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe they had, this had been no coming up to the condition of the Coyenant of works; for this Light is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101119:33"/>able perfectly to diſcover it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, but thy the commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> If by the help of Scripture, and that meaſure of the ſpirit that was given to <hi>David,</hi> he was not able to ſee the utmoſt bounds of Gods Law; much leſs can this dim Light of it ſelf reveal them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, ſuppoſe this Light had been able to diſcern per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the whole condition of the Covenant of works; and once more, ſuppoſe they had been able from the beginning of Life, to the end to fulfill this alſo; yet being fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being by nature the Children of wrath; if God had not ſome way or other revealed Chriſt to them, they had moſt certainly periſhed; for the Covenant of works is no way of ſalvation for fallen man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. If ever he be ſaved it muſt be by the Covenant of Grace, that holds forth Chriſt. The ſum is this, This Light revealing Duty, their diſobedience did render them unexcuſable; not revealing Chriſt, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could not have excuſed them; for is not he a fighter againſt God, that ſaith, they were unjuſtly by nature the Children of, wrath? Admire we Gods grace for a revelation of Chriſt. If we ſincerely live our Light, that is, the precious Scripture; though our unavoidable failings are many, our God in Chriſt will ſave us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. p. 19. <hi>Why ſhould God give to man this Light, ſurely Gods good will and end is to convince them of ſin, that they may ſee and hate it, and by degrees be drawn out of it, and ſo find mercy and peace and ſatisfaction with the Lord in forſaking ſin and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>

               <p n="2">2. Gods good end in giving this Light is to reveal moral duties, and ſins againſt nature; that avoiding theſe ſins, and practiſing theſe duties, we might be delivered from temporal judgements, as <hi>Nineveh</hi> was; and might enjoy the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſavours.</p>

As to the Common, and this is whereby God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, convince, make offers of Chriſt and Grace, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give a taſte of the heavenly gift; by the preaching of the word, and the common operation of the ſpirit, carrying the word into the Conſciences of men; for the word of God is quick and powerful, piercing to the dividing aſunder of the Soul and Spirit. God had ſo ſet up his Kingdom in them, as he had not in the Heathen. They are therefore called the <hi>Children of the Kingdom, Mat.</hi> 8.12. Of the Kingdom only in this common Adminiſtration of it, for they were to be caſt out; and the Kingdom of God was to be taken from them.</item>
                  <item>2. As to the ſpecial Adminiſtration of it; and this is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God awakens ſouls, unites them to Chriſt by a lively Faith, makes them willing ſubjects, and ſtabliſhing them in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, preſerves them to glory; by his word, and by his ſpirit, powerfully applying it to their hearts, inlightning, renewing, quickning, comforting, and dayly aſſiſting them. God had not thus ſet up his Kingdom in the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> for his Kingdom, as to this Adminiſtration of <hi>it, is not in word, but in power:</hi> 1 Cor. 4.20. <hi>Is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17.

That night reflecting upon his paſſage, I was very much diſturbed in my ſpirit, becauſe I did not more fully ſpeak to this point, laying down the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how upon improvement he might be ſaved, and expreſſing the Truth on the contrary ſide.

                        <hi>TOuching one</hi> Query <hi>in the Diſputation, (whether if a man improve the Light within him, may he not be ſaved?) My Anſwer was, that if he improve it that is, make uſe of it in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture, and look up to God for a bleſſing, he may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I judge it needful to acquaint you with my meaning how he may be ſaved. 'Tis this, God may (I do not ſay, certainly will, much leſs that be is bound, I diſown</hi> Pelagianiſme) <hi>ſo bleſs him, as to give him to ſee, embrace and endeavour to practice his whole mind revealed in the Scripture; that is, (to ſpeak with reference to you) to ſanctifie the Chriſtian Sabbath; ſeek juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed, repent if his ſinful nature, and ſinful motions of his heart; ſubmit to the Ordinances of Baptiſm and the Lords Supper, and in other things univerſally incline his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101119:35"/>heart to pleaſe him; thus may the Lord, through grace, ſave him. I was defective in the Diſputation, that I did not manifeſt this ſo weighty a matter. Yea, and that I did not manifeſt the Truth on the other ſide; which is this. For a Perſon to whom Scriptures are given, to practice no more then what the Light that is in every man doth dictate; rejecting the Scripture, as not obliging, in thoſe things that this Light doth not diſcover, is to fling away his own ſalvation.</hi>

                        <item>1. This Light doth not dictate that the Chriſtian Sabbath is to be kept; but God in Scripture commands, <hi>Remember the Sabbath,</hi> that is, one day in ſeven, which the Lord ſhall chuſe; in Goſpel times, it is not the ſeventh from the creation: <hi>Let no man judge you for the Sabbath day,</hi> and if it muſt be one of the other ſix, which doth the Lord more clearly in Scripture point at, then the firſt day? <hi>To keep it holy, do no manner of work.</hi> To practice no more than what the Light that is in every man doth dictate, is as good as to ſay, <hi>I</hi> will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath, I will work on that day.</item>
                        <item>2.

But the Scripture ſends us to Chriſt for pardon for all ſin, calls to repent of all ſin; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth, that the firſt motion, to ſins are ſins, <hi>(thou ſhalt not covet.)</hi> That the Principles inclining hereunto are ſins: they are called <hi>ſin dwelling in us.</hi> To act no further then the Light that is in every man doth dictate is all one as to ſay, I will not repent of the firſt motions of my heart to ſin, nor of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                        <item>4. The Light that every man hath, doth not dictate that we ought to celebrate the Lords Supper; that is, to meet, to take bread, ſignifying the body of Chriſt by inſtitution, and give thanks, and break it, and give, and take, and eat in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt; to take Wine, and having bleſſed, give it, ſignifying Chriſts blood by inſtitution, and take, and drink to ſhew forth the Lords death. But the Scriptures manifeſt this in all particulars, clearly to be the mind and will of Chriſt, and to the ſanctified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. God in the Scripture commands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25. <hi>Take eat, do this.</hi> To practice no further then what the Light that is in every man doth dictate; is to ſay to a commanding God, I will not take, I will not eat.

                     </list>
                     <p>Have the commands of Chriſts no Authority over mens Conſciences? Or do his commands ceaſe to be his commands, for being written? Doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>the word that I have ſpoken ſhall Judge you? Jo.</hi> 12.48. And is not he reſolved to take <hi>vengeance on them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7.8. Truly theſe words, <hi>Repent, Believe, Baptize, Do this:</hi> Yea, and now (by reduction) <hi>Remember the Sabbath,</hi> are, though writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not only the words of Chriſt, but they are Goſpel alſo. Woe, Woe to thoſe Perſons at the day of Judgement, that are then found to have lived and dyed in Rebellion againſt Chriſts commands by theſe words. Theſe words ſhall Judge them, and for diſobeying the Goſpel, Chriſt will take vengeance on them. To conclude, blame was laid on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that of a long time they had not kept the Paſſeover as it was written, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101119:36"/>30.5.

And the mother of our Lord was careful after the daies of her Purification to offer a ſacrifice, <hi>as it was written.</hi> Knowing it was written ſhe knew ſhe was bound, and heartily obeyed. Theſe inſtances are in things, the Light in all men doth not dictate, as it doth not dictate Juſtification by Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Repentance and Faith in Chriſts blood for pardon of ſinful motions of the heart, and ſinful Principles; the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Chriſtian Sabbath, Baptiſm, and the Supper. The former things inſtanced, the Scriptures declare aboliſhed: Theſe the Scriptures no where reveal, they are aboliſhed. The God of all grace then, open your underſtanding to ſee your duty, and obey fully and not by halves; that following God fully with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> you may be accepted of the Lord.</p>

               <p>Thus it appears the words <hi>I</hi> delivered in the Diſpute, taken in a right ſenſe, are no way in themſelves derogatory to the Truth of God.

'Tis this, Is not the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate teaching of the Spirit the higheſt and ſafeſt Rule to heaven? Is it not ſafer to walk by the immediate teachings of the Spirit in our hearts, than by the teaching of the Spirit in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and to entertain the ſpirits teachings in the Scripture no further then they agree with theſe, than to entertain theſe no further than they agree with the Spirits teachings in the

                  <item>1. He teacheth us Phyſically, by enlightning our minds. Thus Gods Spirit ſo aſſures our hearts that Jeſus is Chriſt, that there is no need in the leaſt we ſhould enquire of men the truth of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>The Anointing which ye have received, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you. John</hi> was confident Seducers ſhould never be able to perſwade them that Jeſus was not the Chriſt. Hence alſo <hi>Paul</hi> could curſe an Angel that ſhould preach any other Goſpel than what he had delivered. This Teaching is no Rule at all, but an help to ſee the Rule.</item>
                  <item>2. He teaches us Morally or Objectively, propounding or ſetting before us Gods Mind or Will to embrace and walk by, 1 <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Comforter ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Theſe Teachings (which take in the things taught) are a Rule; for we muſt walk according to them. And of this way of the Spirits Teaching, muſt we underſtand the Queſtion.</item>
                  <item>3. Let us be informed what is the immediate teaching of the Spirit. There is a <hi>Mediate,</hi> which is done by Means; by the Scriptures, as in the laſt mentioned. The Spirit brings theſe to remembrance, and thus we hear <hi>a word behind us, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it, when we turn to the right hand or to the left,</hi> Iſa. 30.21. By the Miniſtry: Thus the Spirit of Chriſt in the Prophets, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Teſtified to the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> And by other means; even by the works of Creation, and the Light in every man, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Creation to be conſidered, he helps us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a God; thence, that he is to be worſhipped, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, Gods Spirit by theſe teacheth us; for in him we live, move, and have our being; without his help the world could not come into conſideration; without his help no ſuch Concluſion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101119:37"/>could appear hence deducible. By the uſe of Reaſon the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit teaceth the Heathen Moral Duties.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>immediate</hi> teaching of Gods Spirit muſt be that which is done without means. Thus God neither by <hi>Adams</hi> Reaſon, nor any Scripture, nor by the works of Creation; but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, by himſelf, taught him that he muſt abſtain from the Tree of Knowledge: And after his Fall, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head. And afterwards enjoyned Circumciſion to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Ceremonial Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking to him face to face. Immediately by himſelf did he inſpire into the Penmen of the Scripture what they were to write, thereby to diſcover to his people what he would have them to do. When he put Propheſies into the mouths of his Prophets, ſending them with Denunciations againſt any; as the young Prophet againſt <hi>Jeroboam, Jonah</hi> againſt <hi>Nineveh;</hi> when he taught <hi>Paul</hi> the Goſpel by Revelation, all was by his immediate teaching.</p>
               <p>The Terms opened, I ſhall now lay down what I judge the Truth touching this Point, in twelve Anſwers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He who is immediately taught of God, his whole Duty, hath higher honour, than he that is taught it by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. He that walks by the immediate teachings of the Spirit, cannot poſſibly err in ſo doing. Gods Spirit is a Spirit of Truth. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. I know but one man, of all who ever were in the world, unto whom, Gods immediate teachings were the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſafeſt Rule to Heaven: This was <hi>Moſes.</hi> Before the Scripture was written, God did immediately reveal to him the Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial Law: The Ceremonial Law was their Goſpel: Here <hi>Moſes</hi> had the full, the then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the infallible, the trying, the binding Rule, by immediate Revelation delivered to him. Therefore I conclude, Gods immediate teachings were to <hi>Moſes</hi> the higheſt and the ſafeſt Rule to Heaven. But can any man ſhew a ſecond? <hi>Adam</hi> had in innocency immediate revelation; it was but part of his Rule, and ſo no Rule of it ſelf to heaven. Had <hi>Adam</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods immediate prohibition, and violated the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture written in his heart, he had not retained his Innocency: bare forbearing that fruit would not have brought him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101119:37"/>When afterwards, Chriſt was immediately revealed, ſuppoſe he had believed in Chriſt, but wholly neglected that remnant of the Moral Law that ſtill was in his heart, would that Faith have ſaved him? Single out any of the Prophets, who had immediate revelation, as to particular things; did not the Book of the Law written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> bind them? even thoſe Commands which could not all certainly have any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and apparent connexion with what Truths God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately inſpired into them; that they viewing only what was immediately taught them, might herein ſee, and hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all their duty; as to have no need of any recourſe at all to any thing <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote, to help them to know and perform any part thereof? <hi>David</hi> was ſo read, though a Prophet, in the Scripture, and thence learned to fear God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19.</p>

It makes for our ſafety, to look up, earneſtly to pray, and uſe all means for the Illumination of Gods Spirit; that the <hi>eyes of our underſtanding being enlightned, we may know what is the hope of the Fathers Calling, and what the riches of the glory of his Inheritance in the Saints.</hi> Unto Believers God doth thus reveal <hi>that which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can enter into the heart of man to conceive.</hi> Hereby 'tis, they ſee <hi>Eye to Eye;</hi> that is, brightly; <hi>Faith being the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen.</hi> They ſee the King in his Glory. And this he doth accompanying the Miniſtration of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>He hath ſent me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to preach recovering of ſight to the blind.</hi> The Goſpel therefore is called <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spirit.</hi> This we muſt attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Lydia</hi> did, that we might have our hearts opened; and <hi>may be able to comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> This we may hopefully watch for; God hath covenanted, <hi>I will put my Laws into their minds:</hi> and purpoſed, to <hi>deſtroy the face of covering caſt over all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

And for our furtherance in holineſs, let (me ſtep a little out) we are to look up for Gods gracious Spirit to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, aſſiſt and comfort us.

As we ſtand in need of, ſo we may with good hope look up for Gods Spirit to ſanctifie, aſſiſt, comfort us.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 6. (To return again) When we are at a loſs at any time for Gods will and the way we ſhould walk in, we may very ſafely look up for the <hi>Mediate Objective</hi> Teachings of Gods Spirit, to be directed. As heretofore, when Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wanted direction in a particular caſe, they enquired of God, (as in the caſe of going to War, or the like) God did <hi>immediately</hi> ſhew them his will; ſo now have Gods people good grounds to believe that God will <hi>mediately</hi> teach them, and reſolve all their doubts in neceſſary things, if they heartily ſeek it of him. Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>The Spirit ſhall bring to your remembrance,</hi> Acts 15. Gods Church was troubled with a doubt neceſſary to be determined <hi>[Whether the Gentiles muſt be circumciſed?] Peter</hi> brings an Argument from experience, to prove, they need not. <hi>James</hi> minds his Argument, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Simeon hath declared how God at the firſt did viſit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his Name. And to this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>agree the words of the Prophet.</hi> Who brought this to his mind? Here we ſee it fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Spirit brings ſutable Scriptures to remembrance to teach Gods people in doubtful caſes. This is the <hi>mediate objective</hi> Teaching of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 7. But what warrant have all men, nay, Gods people
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101119:38"/>now, to expect a Revelation of all Truths neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by the immediate objective teachings of Gods Spirit? It is not for us to expect and promiſe our ſelves or others this, if the Lord hath no where promiſed it. Can it be proved, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Spirit ſhall lead you into all truth,</hi> that this is to be underſtood without means? without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? When God ſaith, <hi>They ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me:</hi> The ſenſe is, they ſhall not teach as the unconverted are to be taught, who believe not, who have no ſaving knowledge of God at all: So they who have received <hi>the anointing,</hi> need not, as doubting and unbelieving perſons, that any teach them that Jeſus is the Chriſt. Can it be proved that the words are to be underſtood in that ſenſe, as to exclude the Miniſtry from edifying the Body of Chriſt till we all come in the unity of the Faith? This Aſſertion, <hi>That God is pleaſed objectively and immediately by his Spirit to reveal to all men, or to his own people at leaſt, all Truths, and all Duty neceſſary to Salvation, ſo that they need not mind the Scripture; but only wait for theſe immediate objective Teachings:</hi> is the Wile of Satan, whereby evil men take people off from what they acknowledge the full and the only Rule, to lead them into a thouſand Errours. I prove it an Errour by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. God hath promiſed, that in order to his peoples inſtruction in matters neceſſary to Salvation, his Word ſhall concur with his Spirit to the end of the world. Therefore 'tis not his pleaſure to teach his people theſe neceſſary Truths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or without the word; much leſs to teach all men. The promiſe we have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, ſaith the Lord, my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seeds Seed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. God never, from the beginning of the world to the Apoſtles days, ſo taught his Church; much leſs all men: Therefore 'tis without reaſon, to imagine, he doth ſo now. Not in Innocency; for the Moral Law he taught <hi>Adam</hi> by that Light he was created with; which Moral Law contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101119:39"/>neceſſary Truths to his Salvation. In <hi>Moſes</hi>'s days, though he himſelf was ſo taught, yet none elſe; the Church was taught <hi>mediately</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miniſtry. In the Apoſtles days, the Church was taught by their Miniſtry. The Apoſtles themſelves had immediate Revelation; the Prophets alſo: but, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Excepting <hi>Moſes,</hi> there cannot a man be ſhewn, to whom God by immediate Revelation diſcovered all Duties ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation: <hi>Paul</hi> might ſeem the moſt likely; but though the Goſpel was ſo manifeſted to him, yet not the Law; this was partly by the Law of Nature, partly by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the works of Creation, eſpecially by the Scriptures. How fond is the Conceit then, that the whole Church ſhould now be ſo taught?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Had it been Gods purpoſe in Goſpel times, to teach all men; nay, to teach his whole Church immediately all their Duty; then would he not have provided for this end, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; inſpiring his word into Holy men, and moving them to write it, and enduing them with the Spirit of Propheſie, and the Spirit of Miracles, to render them credible; that without heſitancy his Church might embrace the word wrote by them, for the undoubted Truth of God.</p>
               <p>Had this been Gods pleaſure, he would not have appointed a Miniſtry, and that to continue to the end of the world; for this very end to inſtruct his Church in thoſe Truths that are neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Go, preach,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I am with you always, to the end of the world.</hi> And <hi>he gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Paſtors and Teachers for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of Faith.</hi> Did God provide Scripture, and appoint Miniſters, with an intent not to uſe them? but to do all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his Spirit, without them? When God gives Means, he doth not ordinarily work without means, but by them. It is worth obſervation, where the Scripture and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry are vouchſafed, the Heathen attain only to know Moral Duties; nothing of Chriſt. Is it not becauſe God concurs to teach them, with the means they have, the Law of Nature; but doth not ſupply the want of means, they have not, to teach them immediately Jeſus Chriſt? Where therefore he hath given Scriptures and the Miniſtry, he doth not ordinarily
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101119:39"/>teach without them. Men may as well expect God ſhould ordinarily preſerve life and ſtrength without Bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Immediate teachings were extraordinary things: Therefore not to be expected by all men; nor ordinarily, and for continuance, by the Church. Look on them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Samuel,</hi> or any of the Prophets, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Thoſe perſons choſen above any for God thus to reveal himſelf to: The Revelation at certain times only, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord called</hi> Samuel, and to him denounced Judgment upon <hi>Elies</hi> Houſe. It was ſo extraordinary, that <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> v. 20. <hi>from Dan to Beerſheba,</hi> took notice of it, and hereby <hi>knew that Samuel was eſtabliſhed a Prophet of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 21. It is ſaid, <hi>God appeared to him again in Shiloh.</hi> This was no ordinary thing. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſions no ordinary things; nor were <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dreams, nor <hi>John</hi>'s Revelation. Every one, nay, every Believer muſt not look that the Sun ſhould ſtand ſtill at his Prayers, or the Sea be driven back for him. This were to confound ordinary with extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. He that is by the Spirit immediately taught the Goſpel, can ſay, <hi>I received it not of man, neither was I taught it, but by Revelation of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But every Believer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſo: Therefore every Believer is not immediately taught the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If immediate teaching be a ſufficient Rule to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then Believers need not hear the Word, or read the Scriptures: But God commanding Believers <hi>(Be ſwift to hear, Remember the Law of Moſes my Servant. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the word of Propheſie ye do well to attend. Thou ſhalt read,</hi> Deut. 17.10.) puts them not upon a needleſs duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. If every Believer hath immediate teachings, then every one of them can write Gods mind as infallibly as the Pen-men of the Scripture. Then every believer may add to the Scripture, and enlarge the Churches Canon. Whereas, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. God did deliver the Churches Canon by parts, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but now by his Son; which oppoſed to the former, diſcovers the whole Canon is by Chriſt delivered; no more parts, that may be added, are now to be expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9 They that hold this, muſt either ſay, God immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveals the ſame Truth and Duty that are contained in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101119:40"/>Scripture, or divers from theſe: If the ſame, this is to ſay, God doth that of which there is no need at all, becauſe 'tis done already: that he doth that in an extraordinary way, which he hath already done in an ordinary: He feeds <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Manna,</hi> after that they are furniſhed with the Corn of <hi>Canaan.</hi> If divers, this is to ſay, there is another way to heaven beſide that that is laid down in Scripture. But it is acknowledged, that Gods will laid down in Scripture is a full Rule, an only Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. Satan caſts evil motions into us; the Spirits are to be tried; falſe Teachers to be convinced: Therefore 'tis falſe that we need not mind the Scripture, but only wait for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teachings. Having already proved Satans acceſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the Antecedent is clear. The Conſequent I thus make good.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If we cleave not to the Rule given, the Scripture, and try by it, 'tis eaſie for Satan to prevail with us to embrace his injections for good. If our firſt Parents, in a ſtate of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and knowing it was the Devils Counſel, not holding to the Rule given, were prevailed upon; much more may we, who are not always ſo ſure 'tis Satan, when he is buſie with us, and who have not attained to <hi>Adams</hi> perfection.</item>
                  <item>2. Spirits cannot ſo well be tried, falſe Teachers cannot at all be convinced, by immediate teachings, as a Rule. By the Scripture they may. Two things in order hereunto, are to be examined; the Doctrine of the Spirits, and the Lives of the Teachers. Suppoſe then a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould teach, the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> is not come pretending immediate Miſſion and Revelation for this: <hi>G. W.</hi> to convince him, tells him, 'tis a falſe Doctrine; for I am ſent and taught by the Spirit immediately, that he is come. The <hi>Jew</hi> laughs at him, and tells him he is deluded: <hi>G.</hi> hath no more to ſay. But when <hi>Apollos</hi> took the <hi>Jews</hi> to task, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.28. <hi>He mightily convinced them, and that publickly, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Scripture that Jeſus was Chriſt.</hi> Again, If a man walks naked in the Market-place, crying out againſt ſin, if another kills himſelf by Faſting; if a third gives himſelf up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Fornication; and all theſe pretend immediate Revelation their warrant, it is not ſufficient to their Conviction, for a man to tell them, I am immediately taught of God; that in you theſe are ſins. The other will deride, you fancy your
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101119:40"/>ſelf ſo taught of God, but you know not the depths of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as I do. <hi>I am a Propheteſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jezebel, Rev.</hi> 2.20. But Gods word written in the Scripture plainly condemning theſe things in all, convincingly ſhews them odious every where, and is enough to ſtop their mouthes that dare plead for their Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. I ſhall adde this. The ſpirit doth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reveal the whole Bible to Believers; therefore, he doth not reveal immediately to them all their duty. For, 'tis their duty to believe all that is there taught, to practice all that is there commanded. The Scriptures a binding Rule to prove this. Thus it appears, immediate Revelation of our whole duty is not vouchſafed: therefore have we no warrant to expect it. To look for it is preſumption; to fancy we have it is to pride our ſelves in a Lye; and will cauſe to deſpiſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 8. To refuſe the teachings of Gods ſpirit in the Scripture unleſs ſo far as they agree with immediate teachings within, cannot be ſafe. It is to limit and tempt the Lord, to impoſe upon him; as ſaying, thou ſhalt immediately teach me firſt, or I will liſten to nothing in thy Scripture. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, an Heathen coming amongſt us and reading or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel muſt not entertain it, becauſe it was never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taught him by the ſpirit. A Child muſt not obey any thing of the Scripture till it be firſt immediately taught him. But, <hi>If any ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Propheſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life,</hi> Rev. 22.19. <hi>Curſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to do them,</hi> Deut. 27.26. The Scriptures are binding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 9. It cannot but be very ſafe to attend unto, and obey the Teachings of Gods Spirit in the Scriptures. There is no inward Revelation can be more ſure. As to us, the Scriptures are a more ſure word of Prophecy, and unto it we do well to give heed. And <hi>Bleſſed is he that Readeth, Rev.</hi> 1.3. If through the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, with ſincerity, integrity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy a man walks according to Scripture Rule, he cannot poſſibly miſs of Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 10. The Holy Ghoſt will not be offended to have any of his other teachings tryed by his teachings in the Scripture.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101119:41"/>This he approves in the <hi>Bereans,</hi> ſafely may we therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what is agreeing with the Scripture; ſafely reject what agrees not with it. Gods will laid down in Scripture being the only Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 11. To make immediate teachings without tryal, our Rule, is to expoſe our ſelves to a thouſand errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 12. The teaching of Gods Spirit in the Scripture is the higheſt and ſafeſt Rule to heaven. It is moſt ſafe to walk by this. It is not ſafe to refuſe the teaching of the Spirit in the Scripture, becauſe we find not immediate Teachings that agree therewith, but very ſafe not to entertain immediate Teachings of the Spirit until we know they agree with Scripture, becauſe we are enjoyned to try the Spirits. And now by all that hath been ſpoken hitherto, it eaſily appeareth that Quakers have have no ſaving Rule, by which they walk, no ſound founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which they build. We are built on the <hi>Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets</hi> laid down in Scripture. This is our Rule, this is our foundation; here we fetch all Doctrines for our Faith, hence all directions for our practice. But what is their Rule, their foundation? If they ſay the Light in every man; then they muſt fetch all their Doctrines, all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections hence. But this is ſand; for it reveals but a ſmall part of their duty, and not a word of Chriſt. This failing, they uſually fly to immediate Revelation. If this be their Rule, their foundation; they muſt receive hence all Doctrine, all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection neceſſary to ſalvation. If they receive ſome only, 'tis but a ſorry foundation; they cannot build on it, for full directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If they look for the knowledge of all Doctrines, all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hence; they build on a Caſtle in the Air, a meer fancy; for though God can, he doth not, he never did immediately teach his Church all they were to believe and practice.</p>

Sometimes the word <hi>(fulfil)</hi> is uſed to ſignifie, <hi>moſt perfect exact and through conformity to every title of Gods Law.</hi> Mat. 15.17, 18. <hi>I came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil.</hi> And thus in the other world, Gods people ſhall attain to fulfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law; but not in this. He that affirms it, muſt prove it.</p>

Yet our Divines underſtand the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Juſtification.</hi> This being the Scope of the Apoſile, to prove no condemnation to believers, becauſe the Goſpel or Law of the Spirit of Life frees them from the condemning power of the Law of Works; becauſe God ſent his Son and condemned our ſin in him, who had perfectly obeyed the Law; that through the imputation of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, we might be looked on, as if from the beginning of Life to the end, to have obeyed the Law as creatures, to have ſatisfied it as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>You plead for Sin.</hi> This is in every ones mouth. An opprobrious and groſs ſlander.</p>

Their Light without the Scriptures will help to call men off from Lying, Injuſtice, Uncleanneſs, Diſobedience to Parents, and ſuch like Duties of the Law of Nature. And do we tell men it is not needful to forſake theſe ſins? We urge men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake theſe; and to the obſervance of the Chriſtian Sabbath: we preſs to ſecret Prayer, and prayer in the Family; to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101119:45"/>of God a Bleſſing on the food we take, after the example of Chriſt, we preſs to repent of the very being of an evil thought in us, ariſing out of our hearts; and of a Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining us to offend; we preſs the Celebration of the never aboliſh'd Ordinances of Baptiſm and the Supper; we preſs to ſeek remiſſion by the Blood of Chriſt. All theſe, according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, on whom, with the reſt of the true Church of God, we are built; and according to the unerring Rule of Gods word written. Who do preſs men unto Holineſs? who do call men off from Sin more than we?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Do not we denounce againſt men, that if they allow themſelves in any Sin and Wickedneſs, they muſt periſh to Eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Do we not ſay, it is the duty of all to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and to preſs after it; to watch againſt all, even the leaſt ſins; to repent of every failing, and fly to Chriſts blood, and Gods free Grace for pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. We do indeed tell men that God will accept of their ſincere and true endeavour to do all, flowing from Faith in his Grace, and the Merits of Chriſt, though they cannot attain to be quite free from Sin. It may be, he will ſay, this Doctrine encourageth to Sin: But I ſay, this Doctrine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally encourageth to ſtrive againſt Sin, and endeavour after Holineſs; whereas the contrary diſcourageth and takes men off from their endeavours. If two Companies of Children were to run a Race, and one ſhould ſay to <hi>this</hi> Company, there are ſtrong men at the end of the Race; if you run as ſtrong and as faſt as they can run, you are to enjoy a rich inheritance, but if not, you are to die: Another ſhould ſay to <hi>that</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, though you are not able to run as laſt as <hi>men,</hi> and as ſtrongly, yet if you do your beſt endeavour, and hold out, you are to enjoy the rich inheritance; I ask which of theſe two did ſpeak moſt to the encouragement of their Companies? The former ſpake to the cutting off their endeavours, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, the latter to the putting of Courage and Life into them. Thus 'tis here: ſaith the <hi>Quaker</hi> to his Company, In Heaven, which is the end of the Race, there are <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> you muſt obey as perfectly as they; there muſt be no ſin at all in you, and then you ſhall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101119:45"/>obtain Salvation; but if otherwiſe, you muſt look to periſh. Saith the <hi>Scripture-Miniſter</hi> to his Company, Though you cannot attain in this life to be as pure as thoſe in heaven; yet, if by Faith you fly to Chriſts Blood and Merits, and ſincerely endeavour to pleaſe God in all things, and hold out thus to the end, God will graciouſly accept and ſave you. I appeal to the very Conſciences of all <hi>Quakers</hi> now, who is it that doth moſt encourage to preſs after Purity and Holineſs? Muſt they not according to this Doctrine, ſay, I muſt be quite free from all ſin here, or burn in hell to all eternity; <hi>I</hi> have tried to get free, theſe 3, or 6, or 10, or 20 years, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all this time attain it; and what ground can I have of better hopes for the future, than I have had all this time? I may not look for it. And if I may not come to heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in this Life I get free from all ſin, I am ſhut out from Mercy; to what purpoſe ſhall I preſs after Holineſs? Such muſt needs be the workings of their hearts, who will believe there is no ſalvation without perfect freedom from ſin in this Life.</p>
               <p>I come now to lay down more Arguments againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, having already urged one, from <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.

How did <hi>Paul</hi> find it? <hi>Phil.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Not as though I were already perfect. Paul</hi> was ſenſible of his imperfection. Compare this with <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded;</hi> that is, let as many as are well grown in Grace, ſee and be ſenſible of our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or let not any pretend to be well grown in Grace, that will not look on himſelf as imperfect.

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> afterwards denied himſelf to be perfect. Therefore God ſpeaking true, he was perfect, that is, upright, ſincere, well grown in Grace. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking true, he was not perfect, that is, not free from all ſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But he did attain Perfection afterwards,</hi> Job 23.10, 11. <hi>I ſhall come forth as Gold, my foot hath held his ſteps.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though to that time he had been upright and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt with God, and was confident ſhould ſo perſevere, yet was he not free from ſin; for after this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.4. <hi>I am vile,</hi> ſaith he.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. To dive a little deeper. We ſhould not have one evil principle in us inclining us to offend God. This is called Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſin reign.</hi> Rom. 7.17. <hi>Sin dwelling in me.</hi> ch. 7.8. <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Law, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence.</hi> It is called the <hi>Body of Sin,</hi> c. 6.6. <hi>The Law of Sin,</hi> c. 7.23, 25. I asked, Was ſuch a ſtate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life, as to be wholly free from all evil principles?

He acknowledged it. This muſt be an evil principle inclining to offend God. He denied it not. But his Anſwer then was agreeable to <hi>p.</hi> 22. <hi>After a while all evil Principles are purged out, and then the Father ceaſeth from purging.</hi> But to this effect was the Reply; this man whom you ſuppoſe to have all evil principles purged out of him, either is in Chriſt bearing fruit, or not.

               </p>
               <p>He oppoſeth further: <hi>Becauſe it is the Fathers purging, ſin muſt needs be perfectly purged out.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then every fruitful Chriſtian is inſtantly freed from all ſin.

To prove the point:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. What God hath inſtituted for his Church, and not repealed, is ſtill binding: But God hath inſtituted Baptiſm with water for his Church, and not repealed it: Therefore Baptiſm with water is ſtill binding.</p>

O that my wayes were directed to keep thy Statntes.</hi> A gracious ſoul keeping Gods Statutes in Scripture, and Gods Commands to keep them, can from Faith and Love heartily, and with longing deſire embrace and cloſe with them.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with water <hi>hath been inſtituted of God.</hi> Firſt God gave <hi>John</hi> Commiſſion to baptize with water, <hi>John</hi> 1.33. <hi>He that ſent me to baptize with water.</hi> The Inſtitution was after confirmed by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Saith <hi>G. W. Here is no mention of water. It is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Baptiſm we are to underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That we are to underſtand <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with water, theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Chriſt commands them <hi>their Duty.</hi> But though it be their duty to <hi>endeavour</hi> to baptize ſpiritually or convert men; yet it is not their duty to <hi>convert men;</hi> for ſuppoſing their diligence, 'tis <hi>not their ſin</hi> if perſons be not converted, or ſpiritually baptized. God never gave them power thus to change mens hearts. <hi>Their</hi> work is one, <hi>the Holy Ghoſts</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If teaching be external, baptizing is external. You may as well ſay, they are to do the Spirits Office in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing internally, as the Spirits Office in baptizing internally. Its evident, they are enjoyned a work in their power, and a work diſtinct from the work of the Spirit, in that his preſence to do <hi>his work</hi> is promiſed, whilſt they do <hi>theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have thanked God he baptized ſo few, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. if baptizing ſpiritually had been his work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If we are to underſtand ſpiritual baptiſm, then as many as the Apoſtles baptized, were certainly ſanctified: but what was <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> Acts 8.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If this be Chriſts meaning, and there be no other <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the Church than ſpiritual; then every Believer and ſanctified perſon is already baptized; and no more is to be done to him, as ſignified by this word. But Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that even Believers be baptized, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a devout man, ſanctified already, and the Holy Ghoſt fell on him; yet after all this, he is baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>0. <hi>Criſpus</hi> and many <hi>Corinthians</hi> believed, yet were alſo baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. Nay, therefore baptized, becauſe Believers.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:101119:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If the Apoſtle did afterwards baptize with water, then we are to underſtand Chriſt as commanding Baptiſm with water: but they did. This was denied in the Diſpute. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36. <hi>See, here is water, what doth binder me to be baptized.</hi> And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized?</hi> I asked, how can we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our Conſciences better of the meaning of Chriſt, than by the practice of the Apoſtles? It was anſwered, <hi>The Apoſtles knew not the mind of Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Robert Ludgater</hi>'s Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence called for pity. Here's a Fellow, ſaid I, takes upon him to know the mind of Chriſt better than the Apoſtles. Upon which, he was blank'd, and neither he, nor any of the reſt attempted to give any Anſwer to this Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Baptiſm with water was inſtituted <hi>for the Church,</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> It was not inſtituted for one or ſeveral perſons by name, but all Nations, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.5. In the City of <hi>Samaria, Philip</hi> baptized both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8. Many <hi>Corinthians</hi> believed, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. So the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptized with water; <hi>Cornelius alſo, and his Company,</hi> Acts 8.36. &amp; 10.47. already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>extent</hi> both of the Inſtitution and of the Practice, prove, it was inſtituted for the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Inſtitution of Baptiſm by water for the Church, was <hi>never repealed:</hi> Shew when.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. John</hi> muſt decreaſe, Chriſt muſt increaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. John</hi>'s honour muſt. As the Light of the Morning-Star decays by the Riſing of the Sun. Here is no Repeal; and Chriſt confirmed the Ordinance after <hi>John</hi>'s death.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>There is but one Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; but this hath two parts, the <hi>Outward,</hi> or the Sign, which is water, applied by the Miniſter: the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> or thing ſignified, which is the Queſtion of a good Conſcience. This we obtain by the Spirit, rendring the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means effectual, which is far from repealing it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Then 'tis but the outward part of Baptiſm that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We agree in this, that the queſtion of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is neceſſary. We differ in this, whether the uſe of water, as ſignifying it, be a binding Ordinance?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>There is a diſtinction between Baptiſm of water and of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101119:49"/>the ſpirit, as between</hi> Johns <hi>Baptizing with water and Chriſts with the holy Ghoſt and fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Scripture calleth ſometimes the work of the Miniſter, ſometimes the work of the ſpirit, Baptiſm: and they differ as much as the ſign and the thing ſignified in one and the ſan e Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm and Chriſts are in ſubſtance the ſame, for when <hi>John</hi> Baptized with water, the ſpirit of Chriſt was given to purge and ſanctifie; and when Chriſt Baptizeth with the Holy Ghoſt it was in the uſe of water. <hi>Eph</hi> 5.26. <hi>He ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> Here is nothing yet to prove a Repeal.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Divin. of Chriſt,</hi> Second part, p 49. <hi>The ſubſtance come, the ſhadows fly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By the ſubſtance do you mean ſanctifying grace, and the Queſtion of a good Conſcience? <hi>[Lord what wilt thou have one to do?]</hi> ſince Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Go, Teach, Baptizing;</hi> had you that ſubſtance, you would ſtand for this Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm with water. When the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the three thouſand, <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Jaylor were converted, they were for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The true ſubſtance aboliſhing ſhadows, is not Chriſt in us, or his Image drawn over our ſouls in ſanctification; he was thus in the ſanctified when the ſhadows ought to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; but Chriſt in our Nature dying for us. And this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Chriſt perſonally conſidered, hath eſtabliſhed Baptiſm with water, as hath been ſhewn. This objection therefore contains Blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, it is as much as to ſay to Chriſt inſtituting this ſhadow, thou forgeteſt thy ſelf: thou knowſt not what thou doeſt; but will men be wiſer then Chriſt? beware</p>
               <p>Ob. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Baptiſm ſaves, not the putting away the filth of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>[not]</hi> is not an abſolute Negation, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative; and ſignifies <hi>[not ſo much]</hi> for our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. tells us plainly; Baptiſm doth conduce to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Paul was not ſent to Baptize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſame anſwer ſerves here. Preaching being a more weighty work, <hi>Paul</hi> committed Baptizing to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as Chriſt did to his Diſciples. The ſame manner of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101119:49"/>ſpeech we have, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. <hi>I will have mercy and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pag. 34, <hi>Tis Objected, Being wicked, their Sacrifices were not accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But will you ſay, ſacrificing was not their duty, when God gave them Commandment for it? till Chriſts death, God did require it.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>If mercy and knowledge of God had born ſway among them, there had been no need or occaſion for Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Since it did not, according to confeſſion there was need of ſacrificing; yet ſaith God I will have mercy and not ſacriſice: The ſenſe then muſt needs be <hi>[not ſo much.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Man bringing guilt with him into the world, had he been able all his days to live like an Angel, there had been need of offering ſacrifice for that guilt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sacrificing being then Gods Inſtitution, Holineſs did not diſoblige men from it; but rendred them the more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious to do their duty.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And doth a broken Spirit diſoblige him that hath it from obeying Gods Inſtitution? Let it be remembred, <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſts death puts an end to the ſacrifices of the Law.</hi> Though God valued mercy, and valued a broken Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Sacrifice, yet his Inſtitution could not ceaſe binding to the Jews till the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>If Paul bad a command to Baptize, he would not have thanked God for not obeying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If Chriſts inſtitution had been only a ſpiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſin, and not a Baptiſm with water, he would not have thanked God that he Baptized ſo few. He had a command to Baptize, but if his Aſſiſtant did it, he was not obliged to do it over again. He only thanks God it was done by other hands, not his own, leaſt they ſhould have taken occaſion, had he baptized them, to ſay he did it in his own name.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> had a command to baptize is evident. 1. From that general precept, <hi>[Go, Teach, Baptize.]</hi> He being a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, and an Apoſtle, and the inſtitution of Chriſt not ceaſing in his days, it muſt needs be that <hi>Paul</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Commiſſion. 2. Had he not command, he had ſinned in baptizing any, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14, 16. <hi>Lydia,</hi> the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101119:50"/>Goaler, running without being ſent; had not <hi>John</hi> (greatly ſinned if he had baptized, and had not been ſent of God? ſo had <hi>Paul.</hi> 3. Baptiſm is Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> had a Commiſſion to diſpenſe the Goſpel. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. <hi>A diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is committed to me.</hi> Therefore he had a Commiſſion to diſpenſe Baptiſm. It was ſaid <hi>Baptiſm is not Goſpel.</hi> And anſwered what is inſtituted by Chriſt after his death muſt needs be Goſpel, but Baptiſm was inſtituted by Chriſt after his death. Here they had no more to ſay; and the thing is plain, either it is a Legal, or it is an Evangelical inſtitution. What is appointed to ſignifie Chriſt already come, is in a moſt proper ſenſe Evangelical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. It is now objected, <hi>The Goſpel is everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Baptiſm with Water is to laſt to the end of the world, and the benefit and fruit of it, to the choſen, to all eternity. So the Preaching of the Goſpel is to laſt to the end of the World, and the benefit and fruit of it to the choſen for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Thus it appears they cannot prove that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm with Water is repealed. And indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part of the Ceremonial Law which was put an end to by Chriſts death, nor of the Judicial Law, which was but temporary; ſince it was appointed to continue after his death, how fond muſt it needs be to imagine a repeale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. What is inſtituted to continue to the end of the world binds ſtill. Baptiſm with water was inſtituted to continue to the end of the world. <hi>Go, preach, baptizing, I am with you always to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The command was given to them, not as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but as <hi>Miniſters;</hi> for ſo was the command of preaching; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter not requiring any extraordinary call or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for it. But Miniſters are to continue to the end of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.13. Therefore all Miniſters are concerned in the command, and muſt obey it as long as Chriſt continues then.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When <hi>Mtathew</hi> uſeth the expreſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

Now let the World judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe that teach among the Quakers be not Rebels againſt Chriſt, as <hi>I</hi> called them; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Go, Baptize;</hi> the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of their practice is (if they have been baptized) <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouace my Baptiſm,</hi> if any of them were born Quakers, (for Quakers is but of yeſterday) <hi>I never was, never will be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, I neither will baptize, nor ſuffer others to be baptized.</hi> If allowed rebellion doth not conſtitute a Rebel, what doth? yet <hi>I</hi> am far from looking on the Adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as the duty of any of theſe men, becauſe they are no true Miniſters of Chriſt; herein they are rebellious only, in that they take themſelves to be Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Adminiſtration, The point being clear that Baptiſm with water is Gods Ordinance binding us: is it not our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſubmit to it? Chriſt ſanctifieth his Church by the waſhing with water; promiſeth, he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved. Are we not enemies to our ſelves and children, if we reject a means of Sanctification, a means of Salvation? Is not God a Jealous God in matters of his worſhip? Hath he not ſaid, curſed is he that diminiſheth? and who can be guilty of diminiſhing if he be not, who pulls down where God hath not pulled down, but hath ſet up? Had it not well nigh coſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his life, that he neglected the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of his child? And when God had inſtituted Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, did he not threaten, <hi>the man child not circumciſed the eight day ſhall be cut off, he hath broken my Covenant? Gen.</hi> 17.14. Theſe things are written for our example and for our learning; for whom God hath inſtituted Baptiſm to be of that uſe to us, that circumciſion was of to the Jews. The Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Call upon me, fear me;</hi> the ſame Lord God hath ſaid, <hi>Go, teach, Baptizing,</hi> The Phariſees rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, not ſubmitting to this Ordinance, Chriſt ſubmitted to it: whether ſhall we choſe to imitate Chriſt or the Phariſees?</p>

               <head>Whether the Lords Supper be an Ordinance of Chriſt binding us?</head>
               <head type="sub">For this alſo take theſe two arguments.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. What is ordained of Chriſt for his Church, and not aboliſhed, ſtill binds; but ſuch is the Lords Supper. <hi>It was Inſtituted by Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 26.26, 27. <hi>And as they were eating, Jeſus took bread and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, take, eat, this is my body. And he took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it.</hi> It was inſtituted <hi>for his Church,</hi> 1 Cor, 11.23. <hi>For I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you. v.</hi> 24. <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> He delivered the very command of Chriſt to them, being a Church of Chriſt: plainly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they were all bound to the obſervance of it. Let any ſhew now where did Chriſt ever repeal this Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Divin. of Chriſt, Second part,</hi> p. 50. <hi>The Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to the low capacity of the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>as not grown up to that ſpirituality, to ſee through the outward ſhadows. Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is no Preſident?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle delivered to them the command of Chriſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>This</hi> do, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. This <hi>do.</hi> He warneth them of unworthineſs, under penalty of making themſelves guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. He enjoyns them with due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to obey the commands of Chriſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat.</hi> Is all this but an <hi>Indulgence</hi> or <hi>Sufferance? Paul</hi> preſſeth to have the Inſtitution of Chriſt in a right manner <hi>obeyed</hi> in his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Could not the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſee through the outward ſhadows? were they not believers in Chriſt who is the ſubſtance of all the ſhadows? were they not ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus? <hi>ch.</hi> 1.2. Yet the Apoſtle enjoyns them obedience to the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Either the Apoſtle did deliver to them the commands of Chriſt, or not, and they were to obey the Apoſtles commands as the comands of Chriſt or not. If they were to obey the Apoſtles comands as the comands of Chriſt; then are they to be our Preſident:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101119:51"/>For we are to obey the commands of Chriſt as well as they. Here is no manifeſtation of a repeal.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>It could not in reaſon or truth be enjoyned all others that ſucceed, who ſpiritually enjoy the Communion of the body and blood of Chriſt, where none of their diſorders have any place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This Objection ſeems to yield that Chriſt ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Supper for <hi>weak Coriſtians,</hi> who are ſubject to <hi>Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> but not for <hi>ſtrong:</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are a Preſident for ſuch weak Chriſtians. Then why at leaſt do not thoſe: who look on themſelves as Teachers from Chriſt, among <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> enjoyn, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>ſuch weak ones,</hi> to partake of this Ordinance? Are there no weak ones among them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Will this man take himſelf to be wiſer than Chriſt, and wiſer than the Holy Ghoſt, who inſpired <hi>Paul</hi> to enjoyn the <hi>Corinthians</hi> according to the inſtitution of Chriſt? There was not one ſanctified <hi>Corinthian</hi> but <hi>had Communion with the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> And many of them were <hi>well grounded</hi> in Grace, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>In every thing ye are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</hi> and yet <hi>theſe</hi> even <hi>theſe,</hi> are enjoyned to partake of the Lords Supper, Will he ſay the Holy Ghoſt did not act in reaſon or in truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. A grown Chriſtian may grow more, and he that hath Communion with Chriſt may have further Communion, and he that is ſtrong may yet have more ſtrength, and ſo by this Ordinance be further and further helped on to Salvation. There doth appear then very good reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt ſhould enjoyn ſtrong Chriſtians this duty of partaking the Supper.</p>
               <p>Ob. p. 51. <hi>They who know a beginning in the Spirit ought to wait for this ſpiritual appearance, and coming of Chriſt, and not turn back again to ſhadows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. He condemns <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, which he approved of before. If condeſcending <hi>Paul</hi> acted according to the mind of Chriſt, then true Miniſters <hi>ought</hi> thus to condeſcend and put weak believers upon receiving the Supper, that they might act alſo according to the mind of Chriſt. <hi>

                     </gap>e ye followers of us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as we alſo are of Chriſt.</hi> But if weak believers muſt not partake of it; becauſe a ſhadow, then <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not have condeſcended to give them the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101119:52"/>Lords Command, putting them upon receiving: <hi>examine your ſelves, and ſo eat.</hi> Will this man become <hi>Pauls</hi> Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and pretend to know Chriſts will better then <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2. According to this Doctrine, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ought to have <hi>rejected</hi> the commands of Chriſt by <hi>Paul. [Do this, let a man examine himſelf, and ſo eat.] We do know a beginning in the Spirit, and muſt we return to ſhadows?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. As if partaking of the Supper were <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with waiting for a more full manifeſtation of Chriſt; or <hi>Naaman</hi> waſhing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> could not expect from God a cure of his Leproſic. It is the duty of all believers <hi>in the uſe of means,</hi> which the Lord hath appointed to expect his preſence and his bleſſing; and in the uſe of ſuch means it may be had. If God appoint the blowing of Rams horns, in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Iſrael</hi> may expect the fall of <hi>Jerico's</hi> walls. And ſo in the uſe of the Supper, it being of the Lords own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may expect his gracious preſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> We may expect the confirmation of our faith touching pardon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Though it be a ſhadow, yet <hi>an Evangelical ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> a ſhadow of <hi>the Lords own appointing,</hi> and which he never yet repealed. And ſhall not this be dear to every <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> ſoul? Who is not bound to uphold the unrepealed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Jeſus Chriſt? As every Jew was bound to uphold the Paſſeover in a Holy manner, till Chriſts death did put an end to it: So is every Chriſtian bound to uphold the Lords Supper, Chriſt having neither done, nor ſaid any thing to cauſe the celebration there to ceaſe. And therefore where the Lords unrepealed ordinance are <hi>contemned,</hi> they may <hi>talk</hi> of Chriſts ſpiritual appearance, but they may wait long enough, and with ſmall hope to obtain. <hi>The Lord thy God is a jealous God.</hi> He ſpeaks with reference to <hi>inſtituted worſhip,</hi> as the Supper is. Contemn <hi>this,</hi> expect the Lords <hi>burning wrath,</hi> never look for his gracious preſence, it will not be vouchſafed. Might a Jew have ſaid, I have had a <hi>beginning</hi> in the ſpirit. I muſt wait for a ſpiritual appearance of the Meſſiah; I will not turn back to <hi>this ſhadow of the Paſſeover.</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:101119:52"/>What ſaith God? <hi>Num.</hi> 9.10.13. He ſhall be cut off from his people. See the ſeverity of God in point of inſtituted worth. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Thou ſhalt not diminiſh.</hi> Such are more likely to pull down a <hi>curſe</hi> upon their heads, than obtain the <hi>ſpiritual ſence of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg</hi> 2. What is appointed to continue till Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the end of the world, is ſtill binding. But ſo is the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>As oft as yee at this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi>

Ob <hi>Life of Chriſt within,</hi> p. 40. <hi>we do not read of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother coming in the fleſh yet to be expected, Divin of Chriſt,</hi> p. 49. <hi>Chriſt the induring divine ſubſtance ends all types and his comings and appearance in the fleſh.

               <p>It being clear that the Supper is an Ordinance of the Lords own appointing, never repealed, nay appointed to continue till Chriſts coming in the end of the world.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101119:54"/>him; puniſh the iniquity of Parents upon their Children unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate him.</hi> God reckons thoſe that are Conſcientious Upholders of inſtituted Worſhip, <hi>Lovers</hi> of him. To conclude therefore; <hi>Let us examine our ſelves, and ſo let us eat:</hi> for <hi>if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged of the Lord.</hi>

               <head>Whether we are Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Christ Imputed?</head>
               <p>THis is a Point of great moment. A man may erre in many other things, and yet be ſaved, as by fire; but an Errour in the ſubſtance of this is certain Damnation: All therefore had need be well informed about it.</p>
               <p>By the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, underſtand, his Active and Paſſive Obedience, or his fulfilling the Law in his own perſon, when on Earth, and his ſuffering to the death, according to the will of his Father. By the Imputation of it, underſtand, Gods making it over to us upon believing; his giving, granting, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing it to us, reckoning or accounting it ours.</p>
               <p>As for the word <hi>[Juſtifie]</hi> the Scripture ſometimes, but very rarely, uſeth it to ſignifie, to make juſt by inherent Holineſs, or to ſanctifie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 7. <hi>He ſaved us by the waſhing of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that being juſtified,</hi> &amp;c. It is uſed in contradiſtinction to Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> &amp;c. And thus moſtly: We are therefore to take it in this latter ſenſe; In which it hath two ſignifications, all belonging to the ſame thing. It ſignifies, to <hi>declare Juſt,</hi> Luke 7.35. <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</hi> Pſal. 51.4. <hi>That thou maiſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt.</hi> To <hi>Abſolve, Acquit or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,</hi> Rom. 8.33. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth, who ſhall condemn?</hi> Prov. 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the uſt, are both abomination to the Lord.</hi> Here it cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to make juſt; for this would be no abomination to the Lord.</p>
               <p>As to the thing ſignified. 1. Juſtification implies <hi>an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> true or falſe. When a Father <hi>commends</hi> his Child char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101119:55"/>with no crime, this is <hi>not Juſtification,</hi> but <hi>Praiſe.</hi> The Devil may bring falſe accuſations againſt us. Had man continued in the State of Innocency, no true Accuſations could have been brought againſt him. But now <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Law of God is the true Accuſer of every one of us, <hi>John</hi> 5.45. <hi>There is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes in whom ye truſt.</hi> The Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. The true Accuſation or Charge that it brings, and at the Day of Judgment will bring againſt us, is this: <hi>Thou haſt broken the Law; for thou haſt not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thy life to the end thereof done every thing required in it.</hi> The Law will thus charge us; for it is not <hi>abrogated</hi> or made null: If it were, no wicked man could be condemned by it. But our Saviour tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.17. <hi>It is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than one tittle of the Law to fail.</hi> And we are aſſured, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He that hath ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Juſtification doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe an <hi>Apology</hi> or a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> made by or for the Party accuſed. For if there be nothing pleaded on his hehalf, the Judge may not juſtifie, but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him. This Defence is but two ways to be made; either proving the Accuſation <hi>falſe;</hi> So <hi>Wiſdom is juſtified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> This world cenſures the Wiſdom of God fooliſhneſs, but her Children honour her. And ſo would a good Angel be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if accuſed; the Accuſation would be proved falſe, and that he never from the firſt moment of his Creation, once ſinned againſt God: thus he is capable of being juſtified by inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Or if the truth of the Charge cannot be denied, Juſtice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding: What haſt thou to ſay for thy ſelf, why thou ſhouldeſt not be condemned? the only defence is by pleading, Though I am guilty, yet ſatisfaction hath been made for that guilt. Becauſe therefore the ſame fault cannot be twice puniſhed after ſatisfaction, 'tis as if it never were. This is the only way of Defence <hi>we</hi> have at Gods Tribunal. We cannot plead, we never broke the Law; for <hi>we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God;</hi> But we muſt plead Satisfaction made to the Law and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God, for our guilt, by our Surety the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and evidence our right to the benefit of this Satisfaction, by our Faith in his Blood, even ſuch a Faith as hath wrought by Love.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:101119:55"/>
               <p n="3">3. Juſtification doth formally denote a <hi>Declaration that the Party accuſed is Juſt or Innocent,</hi> and an <hi>Acquittance</hi> of him by the Sentence of the Judge. But this Acquittance, as to us fallen Creatures, is a proper Abſolution or Pardon. Had <hi>Adam</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency been accuſed, his Juſtification had been a Declaration of him Innocent in his own perſon, and an Acquittance of him from all penalty of the Law, as not deſerved. Our Juſtification is a Declaration of us (who have been guilty in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) juſt, or innocent, through the Satisfaction or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt our Surety, made over and reckoned to us, through Gods free Grace, upon our delieving; and an acquitting of us from all penalty of the Law, though deſerved, which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Abſolution or Pardon. So that though <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, or a good Angel, could be juſtified without a Pardon, yet 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould be juſtified any other way, but by being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. To ſum up our Doctrine: If the Queſtion be, <hi>What</hi> is it to be juſtified? The Anſwer is, to be declared juſt, and to be abſolved. If the Queſtion be, <hi>Who</hi> is it that doth juſtifie or pronounce us juſt, and abſolve us? The Apoſtle anſwers it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>It is God that juſtifieth.</hi> If the Queſtion be, We are guilty in our own perſons; <hi>for what</hi> is it that God doth juſtifie us? The Anſwer is, for the Satisfaction or Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>By the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to Juſtification and Life.</hi> If the Queſtion be, <hi>What is it that gives us intereſt in Chriſts Righteouſneſs,</hi> or upon which it is imputed or reckoned to us? The Anſwer is, Our Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> If the Queſtion be, <hi>What will evidence our Faith</hi> to be living and ſound Faith? The Anſwer is, Our ſincere Obedience to the Law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. <hi>You ſee then how that by works a man is juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> We are juſtified by works, as evidencing our Faith living; by Faith, as giving Intereſt in Chriſts Righteouſneſs; by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to us, as conſtituting us righteous, and ſatisfying for our Guilt; for the ſake of which, God doth impute us righteous, and abſolve us. This is the Doctrine we teach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. W.</hi> on the contrary teacheth, that <hi>Juſtification is by Faith in Chriſt, and by the Works that follow Faith, without Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed.</hi> In this we agree, <hi>there muſt be a working Faith, or no Juſtification.</hi> And <hi>we muſt believe in Chriſt for Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:101119:56"/>In this we differ, whereas according to the Law of God, this Charge is, and will be brought againſt us; <hi>You have not from the beginning of your Life to the end perfectly obeyed the Law:</hi> It is therefore demanded, what have you to ſay, why you ſhould not bear the Curſe? <hi>He</hi> ſaith, <hi>Faith in Chriſt, and the Works that follow, without any mention of Chriſts holy Life and Sufferings, is our ſufficient defence againſt this Charge;</hi> is, <hi>that which conſtitutes us righteous before God as the Law requires; and for which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently God doth declare us righteous, and acquit us in Judgment. We</hi> ſay, that <hi>Chriſts holy Life and Sufferings is our only Defence or Apologie againſt this Charge, the only thing that can conſtitute us righteous according to what the Law requires; the only thing for which God doth declare us righteous in Law, and for which he abſolves, and frees us from the Curſe of the Law; as being imputed, and made ours upon believing.</hi> And again, Chriſts holy Life and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, being the only thing for which God doth juſtifie us; <hi>We</hi> ſay, that <hi>Faith in Chriſts Blood and Righteouſneſs, as the only thing that can ſatisfie the Demands of the Law, and Juſtice of God, is the only juſtifying Faith; and that Faith that overlooks this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Chriſts Obedience to the Death, as the only thing that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Demands of the Law and Juſtice of God, is but a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying Faith, whatever it be. He</hi> on the contrary holds, that <hi>Faith in Chriſt for Sanctification only, is enough to bring him to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Controverſie thus ſtated; I come now to prove we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed, and not without it: From which, if I make it good, the other point clearly appears; That that Faith which carries not out the Soul to Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to have it imputed, is but a Soul-deſtroying Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. No man can be <hi>declared Righteous</hi> in a Legal ſenſe, but who hath the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him: But every one that God doth juſtifie, he declareth righteous in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſenſe: Therefore there is no man juſtified but who hath Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed to him. The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved from what hath been already manifeſted. To juſtifie, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare juſt; to declare juſt in a Legal ſenſe; becauſe it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him from the accuſation of the Law; and in juſtifying, God doth judge us by the Law, though by the Goſpel alſo. The <hi>Major</hi> will eaſily appear, if we conſider what 'tis to be righteous in a Legal ſenſe. It is to be inveſted with a ſinleſs Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101119:56"/>from the beginning of Life to the end thereof; for this the Law requires. It doth require perfection, not only in the end of our Lives, but in the middle alſo, and in the beginning. It never allows us to ſin. If at ten years of age a perſon commits Murder, and then lives according to the Law of the Land in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tittle forty years; then arraigned for this, he pleads, that after that Offence he continued to live exactly according to the Law; the Judge cannot pronounce him innocent, and ſo acquit him, becauſe the Law did not allow him to commit Murder any part of his Life. In regard God wants not knowledge and proof of our Offences, if we have had but one evil thought, or have committed but one ſin only, all our dayes, if he looks not on us in his Son, reckoning his ſinleſs Righteouſneſs to us, how ſhould he declare us righteous in a Legal ſenſe? For the Judgment of God is always according to truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2. Having Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed, we are inveſted with an everlaſting Righteouſneſs; he did not ſin, nor was there any guile in his mouth; a ſpotleſs Lamb. We have <hi>that</hi> on, which is a through conformity to the Law from the beginning of Life to the end of Life. But this Righteouſneſs not put on by Faith, we are not inveſted with any thing for which God ſhould declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce us righteous in the ſenſe of the Law; for every mouth muſt be ſtopped all the world is become guilty before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If we are juſtified or pardoned upon the imputation of <hi>Righteouſneſs without works,</hi> then by the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs: But ſo we are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>David</hi> deſcribes <hi>the bleſſedneſs of the Man to whom God imputes Righteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe iniquity is forgiven.</hi> The <hi>former Propoſition</hi> appears hence: becauſe there are but two ways whereby a Creature who hath a Law given him, <hi>Do this and live, failand dye,</hi> may be juſtified, either by pleading he hath done this, and not failed from the beginning of life, to the end; and ſo he is to be juſtified by his works, as Angels are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable: Or if he hath not ſuch works, by pleading the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a Surety. It follows therefore, ſince we have no ſuch works, and yet Righteouſneſs is imputed, it muſt be our Saviours; for he is our Surety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> G. W. <hi>Divin. of Chriſt,</hi> p. 64. ſaith, <hi>This Righteouſneſs is not without the works of true living Faith, but without the works
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101119:57"/>of the Law of works,</hi> which (in the following Page) he explains to be <hi>the Ceremonial Law, requiring Circumciſion.</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>if it ſhould be without the works of Faith,</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> James <hi>would claſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He knows we hold, that he who hath Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed, hath works of ſincere Obedience alſo: that Faith which gives intereſt therein, is a working Faith: This <hi>James</hi> contends for; and that works manifeſt our Juſtification, becauſe they manifeſt the ſoundneſs of our Faith. A perſon is arreſted for a Debt of one hundred pounds, which he hath borrowed, and paid, and received an Acquittance for; the Judge clears him: It might be ſaid, he was cleared by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, as evidencing Payment, for which the Judge clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Thus according to <hi>James, Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Works, as evidencing his Intereſt in Chriſts Righteouſneſs, for which God juſtified him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He acknowledgeth that Righteouſneſs is imputed without works of the Law of works. This is all I contend for. For hence I conclude, that Righteouſneſs which is imputed, muſt needs be Chriſts ſinleſs Obedience from the beginning of Life to the end: becauſe God being true, who hath ſaid, <hi>[Do this and live, fail and die]</hi> and we having all failed, there is no way for us to be juſtified without the Imputation of Chriſts never-failing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He errs, calling the Ceremonial Law a Law of Works; in giving this, the Lord gave a Law of Grace to his people; that which ſuppoſed them fallen, and ſo unable ever by their works to attain to Righteouſneſs, and pointed at Chriſt their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſuppoſe he looks on the works of Faith as conſtituting that Righteouſneſs which God is ſaid to impute. But then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He would make the Scripture ſpeak thus, that God imputes works wrought by us, without works wrought by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if the works of Faith be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, then either the works of Faith <hi>before</hi> we are perfect, or <hi>after</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If <hi>before,</hi> it follows, <hi>imperfect works are juſtifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and that God will declare them righteous or conform to his Law, who are not ſo; for imperfection is not conformity to Gods Law: and that God will acquit them as innocent, who are breakers of his Law; for imperfection is a breach of Gods Law.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101119:57"/>How can this conſiſt with Gods truth, who hath ſaid, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all?</hi> Imperfection is no ſuch continuance. If works of Faith <hi>only after</hi> we are perfect, be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, according to this Doctrine, all the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quakers,</hi> muſt look on themſelves as in a ſtate of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for none of them are yet perfect, end not having reached perfection, they have not a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, ſo are not yet juſtifiable; and dying in their preſent ſtate, they muſt all look for damnation, and to periſh for ever: a moſt ſad and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But were the works of Faith perfect, yet could they not be a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, becauſe not a perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, from the beginning of life to the end thereof. Who dares ſay, Gods Law doth not require this? And if this be the thing Gods Law requires, and God ſaith, <hi>Curſed be he that confirme th not all the words of this Law to do them,</hi> Deut. 27.26. Shew how it conſiſts with the vearcity of God to juſtifie him that hath not in the beginning of Life, as well as in the end, done all the works of the Law, nor is yet inveſted with the ſinleſs everlaſting Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He himſelf excludes the works of Faith from conſtituting out juſtifying Righteouſneſs: For he excludes the works of the Ceremonial Law. And will he ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not in Faith circumciſe his Son?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Since it is not ſaid, he imputes any thing we have performed, <hi>for</hi> Righteouſneſs: but he imputes <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> and ſince Righteouſneſs in point of Juſtification is exact conformity to the Law of God from the beginning of life to the end: it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that the Righteouſneſs imputed is ſomething granted <hi>diſtinct</hi> from whatever hath been performed by us, and that Chriſts Obedience to the Law whilſt on earth, is the thing grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for this only can be called Righteouſneſs in point of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. As we are <hi>made ſinners,</hi> and condemnable by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo are we <hi>made righteous</hi> and juſtifiable by the Obedience of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many were made ſinners, ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be made righteous.</hi> But the former is by Imputation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo is the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. W.</hi> in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi>'s Synopſis, <hi>p.</hi> 20. tells us, <hi>We
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101119:58"/>are made Sinners not by any imputation, but by a real participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Adams <hi>Sin.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As if theſe were inconſiſtent; whereas, <hi>We could not be partakers of</hi> Adams <hi>ſin, were there no Imputation. Adams</hi> ſin was his eating the forbidden fruit; we are not partakers of <hi>this</hi> by our actual commiſſion of it, it muſt be therefore by Gods impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It cannot be ſaid, we are partakers of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, in that we are <hi>perſonal Offenders.</hi> Let the words be weighed. <hi>[By one mans Diſobedience many were made ſinners,]</hi> It is not here ſaid, <hi>By many perſonal Diſobediences</hi> we are made ſinners (though this be true.) <hi>Adams</hi> ſin of eating the forbidden fruit, is really ours, by it are we made ſinners, and this muſt needs be through imputation. The <hi>12th.</hi> verſe clears it. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>In whom we all have ſinned.</hi> Children are not excepted; and yet many of them never committed actual Tranſgreſſion. If it be ſaid, through <hi>Adams</hi> ſin we are deprived of Gods Image; our Natures are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; It is true; this confirms our Doctrine; for this is the <hi>puniſhmem</hi> of the firſt Tranſgreſſion: but how can it be that we ſhould be conceived in ſin, brought forth unclean, and deprived of Gods Image, and thus bear the puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin (before we were ever capable of actual Tranſgreſſion) but that we ſinned in <hi>Adam?</hi> God reckoned that firſt ſin to us as ours? God doth not puniſh that perſon in whom he doth not firſt ſee a tranſgreſſion. We conclude therefore, we are made ſinners not only by perſonal evil, but by imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin alſo. And becauſe we are made righteous by Chriſts Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as we are made ſinners by <hi>Adams</hi> Diſobedience, it follows, this is by imputation alſo, and not by converſion only, as <hi>G. W. p.</hi> 21. would have it.</p>
               <p>This Text ſaith not, We are made righteous by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>many,</hi> that it ſhould be underſtood of every mans own Converſion; but of <hi>one.</hi> As the Diſobedience <hi>Adam</hi> wrought in his own perſon on earth, makes us ſinners; ſo the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience Chriſt wrought in his own perſon on the earth, makes us righteous; which muſt needs be by Gods imputing, reckoning, and making over to us, when Believers,</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101119:58"/>evident; for to be juſtified implies an acquittance or freedom from the Curſe of the Law. The <hi>Minor</hi> alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us. It is for the ſake of Chriſt ſufferings we are freed. And if it be not imputed, and ſo made ours and reekoned to us as under gone for us, how ſhould any of us reap the benefit of it? or one more then another? And if we were not diſcharged from the Curſe for the ſake of Chriſts ſufferings imputed, but for faith, and the works that follow, without the imputation of Chriſts ſufferings, then Chriſt bore the Curſe of the Law for us in vain.</p>

Heb.</hi> 9. The Holy Ghoſt tells us this was in order to remiſſion. What did this ſprinkling Typiſie but the imputation or application of Chriſt ſufferings to us? There is no pardon, no juſtification without it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Chriſts blood cleanſeth from all ſin:</hi> Yet if it be not applyed, how can it cleanſe? Gods promiſe therefore is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.17. <hi>He ſhall ſprirkle many Nations.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24.

For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we may be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him.</hi> It is evident that for the ſake of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, we are pardoned and accepted. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no other way to obtain pardon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſheding of blood there is no remiſſion.</hi> Nor to be accepted. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.3. <hi>What man ſoever there be of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that killeth an Ox or a Lamb or a Goat,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>and bringeth it not to the door of the Tabernacle, blood ſhall be imputed to that man; he hath ſhed blood, and that man ſhall be cut off from his people,</hi> v. 5. <hi>to the end the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>may bring their ſacrifices to the Prieſt.</hi> This Typifies, that if we think to have the beſt ſervices that we are enabled to perform accepted immediately as from us, and not for the ſake of Chriſt our Prieſt preſenting them to the Father for us, in the merit of that ſacrifice he offered once for all; they are ſo far from accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that for this God will cut us off from his people: He will as ſoon accept of <hi>Murther</hi> from us as ſuch a ſervice.

I did argue by a ſimilitude in the ſecond diſpute for explication ſake; becauſe they do ſo much deteſt to hear of <hi>a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs wrought without us,</hi> and will be juſtified by no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but what is wrought within them. Thus I form my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the Righteouſneſs we are juſtified by, <hi>is a garment, a Robe, even the beſt Robe,</hi> then we are juſtified by a Righteouſneſs wrought without us. For our Garments are not wrought within us, but without us; and we may well conceive that the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe of this ſimilitude as for other ends, ſo for this in point of juſtification, to illuſtrate how that Righteouſneſs for which we are juſtified, is wrought without us, even by our Saviour Chriſt when he was upon the earth here, obeying his Father to the death: But the Righteouſneſs we are juſtified by, is a Garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Diſpute I found nothing at all of ſolidity in my Adverſary, ſo much as in his Anſwer to this, <hi>The upright put on Zeal for a Cloak, and Rightcouſneſs for a Garment;</hi> (which is true of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sanctification,) and <hi>is this Righteouſneſs wrought without them?</hi>

However <hi>he may ſometimes.</hi> And that he <hi>doth,</hi> Luke 15.22. <hi>Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him,</hi> I thus prove. By this Robe the Holy Ghoſt underſtands Chriſts Righteouſneſs, even obedience unto death: For, not to ſpeak of <hi>increated</hi> Righteouſneſs, even the <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> Righteouſneſs of God, which never was wrought within or without, but is the Eternal God-head: There is a four fold Righteouſneſs.</p>

For either we muſt be juſtified by <hi>our own perſonal obeying Gods Law or Will, or by our ſureties obeying it for us. Our own perſonal</hi> obediences to Gods will are the deeds of the Law. Whether we obey in our own ſtrength or Gods ſtrength, they are the deeds of the Law; whether we obey from Faith, or without Faith, they are the deeds of the Law: For the Law requires what we do, otherwiſe it were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101119:60"/>not obedience. But how ſull is the Scripture telling us, by the Deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified?

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. That for which we are juſtified muſt be of that worth as to <hi>redeen our loſt ſouls.</hi> But Chriſts ſufferings only, no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs wrought by us, is of that worth as to redeem our loſt ſouls. Therefore for the ſufferings of Chriſt, and not for any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought by us, are we juſtified. This Argument God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, the firſt Diſpute, to preſs with full enlargement on the Conſciences of the People to ſecure them from the ſoul-deſtroying error of this man. He hints it, <hi>p.</hi> 23. And all he anſwers is, <hi>ſuch away of uſtification ſhuts out ſanctification and holineſs;</hi> which is indeed no Anſwer, but an Objection. To which I anſwer, it ſhuts it out from being our juſtifying Righteouſneſs: For if San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Holineſs were it which redeems our loſt Soul, and for which, we are acquitted, in vain did Chriſt ſuffer for us that we might be redeemed and acquitted thereby. But it doth not ſhut it out either as inconſiſtent, or as a needleſs thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> It is ſo far from being inconſiſtent, that they are inſeparable, and the one a means to the other: Flying out of our ſelves, as ſeeing nothing but matter of condemnation in our ſelves, to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith; and apprehending the purity and holineſs of our Saviours heart and life, the ſufficiency of his ſufferings to redeem our ſouls from wrath; and that on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God is ready to forgive and receive us to favour; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our hearts turn to God, we diſlike our ſins, we are ſweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to pleaſe God in all things. Thus God purifies our hearts by Faith. Thus are we ſanctified by Faith which is in Chriſt. And a lively Faith will work by love. And though Holineſs be not needful to conſtitute a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, yet is it needful to teſtifie our love to God and Chriſt for providing ſuch a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for us, and to pleaſe God, and to honour God; and that we may be a good example to our neighbour; and that we might have a good evidence of the foundneſs of our Faith; and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſubjection to God who requires it of us. But to return, I prove the <hi>Major.</hi> Our ſouls were loſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>All were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101119:60"/>dead.</hi> Matth. 20.28. <hi>The Son of man is come to give his life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for many.</hi> If our ſouls were not loſt and undone, what need this? we were lyable to the Curſe, becauſe we had not continued in all; this is to be loſt. And if we were loſt, that for which we are juſtified muſt needs have worth in it to redeem loſt ſouls. What is not ſufficient to redeem our loſt ſouls, cannot be ſufficient to juſtifie us. It is impoſſible to be juſtified, and yet left in a loſt condition. <hi>The Minor</hi> hath two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>No Righteouſneſs wrought by us is of worth</hi> to redeem our loſt ſouls. Conſider the worth of our ſouls. The Body is more then raiment, the natural life is more to us then all the world: <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life.</hi> How preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the ſoul, capable of an everlaſting fruition of God, capable of everlaſting torments in hell? what can we give to God worth our ſouls? Conſider what it is to have our ſouls loſt; it is to have them obnoxious to Gods curſe, which if we have it will be an everlaſting deſtruction from the glorious preſence of God, an everlaſting torment in the flames of hell. Go ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire. Now what can we give to God proportionable to ſo great a loſs, to ſo great ſufferings? Sanctification and Holineſs, or a little faith and the works that follow: This is likely to do. There is no real Sanctification, no real Holineſs, till by Faith a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon flies out of himſelf to Chriſt for redemption. But if it were otherwiſe, could this redeem our loſt ſouls? At Dice a man looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an eſtate of Ten thouſand a year: he to whom it is loſt gives the Looſer a Cottage; the Looſer would fain give this Cottage to have his eſtate again. Thus ſillily thou acteſt who thinkeſt that thy loſt ſoul may be redeemed with any thing of thine without the merit of Chriſts blood and ſufferings. If Faith and the works that follow, if Sanctification and Holineſs without Chriſts dying for thee could ſuffice to redeem thy loſt ſoul, Chriſt gave his Life a ranſom in vain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts ſufferings are of that worth that they are abundantly ſufficient to redee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he is God bleſſed for ever who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Church with his blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. In his ſufferings then there is worth enough, worth abundantly enough to redeem our ſouls for ever: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>He hath obtained eternal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us.</hi> We may be as confident of it as we are that we live. Our ſoul is pretious, and Chriſts blood is as pretious, and far more
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101119:61"/>pretious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. We are not redeemed with corruptible things; but with the pretious blood of Chriſt. Let us then with <hi>Paul</hi> abhor all ſanctification <hi>in us,</hi> all Holineſs, all works of Faith, whatever is wrought by us; <hi>in compariſon</hi> of what we ſpie by faith <hi>in Christ,</hi> And let us put our whole truſt in <hi>Christs ſufferings,</hi> for the redemption and acquittance or diſcharge of our loſt ſouls, from whatever damnation they are by ſin expoſed unto; that is, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. For that only doth God juſtifie us, which doth ſuffice to <hi>turn away his wrath from us.</hi> But Chriſts ſufferings only, not any thing done or ſuffered by us, is that for which God doth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us. This Argument was alſo preſſed the firſt diſpute, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. And there not being one word of anſwer pertinent in his book, I proceed, and prove the <hi>former Propoſition.</hi> Gods wrath hath been kindled againſt us. <hi>A Fire,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. <hi>is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>is prepared. Adam</hi> (unto whom God ſaid, <hi>in the day thou eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thereof thou ſhalt die the death</hi>) ſinned, and kindled Gods wrath againſt himſelf and all his poſterity; for we are by Nature the Children of wrath. In our own perſons likewiſe we have failed of continuing in all, and hence is Gods wrath up againſt us; for <hi>the Law worketh wrath.</hi> If Gods wrath hath been ſtirred up againſt us, it cannot be that we ſhould be juſtified till his wrath be turned away. God burning in his wrath is ready to condemn us, to take vengeance on us, to conſume us as fire; not to juſtifie and acquit us from our ill deſerts. That therefore for which we are juſtified muſt ſuffice to turn away Gods wrath from us. The <hi>next Propoſition</hi> conſiſts of two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing done or ſuffered by us, ſufficeth to turn away Gods wrath,</hi> Heb. 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not.</hi> Iſa. 40.16. Lebanon <hi>is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof ſufficient for aburnt offering.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>The Nations are but as a drop of the Bucket.</hi> How can it be that we poor nothings ſhould be able by doing or ſuffering any thing, turn away the wrath of this Great ſelf-ſufficient Soveraign offended with us? Can fallen Angels do or ſuffer any thing? When we are made to ſuffer in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it is <hi>for ever, for ever</hi> that we ſuffer, becauſe miſerable worms we never can ſuffer enough, that his wrath ſhould be turned away from us. And if burning Ten thouſand Millions of years in Hell is not enough to turn his wrath away; how little reaſon is there
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101119:61"/>to imagine, that a little faith, and the works that follow, ſhould ſuffice? If this were enough, then in vain did Chriſt ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will O God.</hi> In vain was <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover ſacrificed for us;</hi> for what end did he come, for what end was he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us, but that he might make attonement for us, that he might make Reconciliation for the ſins of the People, that he might turn away wrath, and ſo the deſtroying Angel might paſs over us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts ſufferings do ſuffice to turn away Gods wrath from us.</hi> 1 Jo. 2.1, 2. <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, And he is the Propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Heb. 13.12. <hi>But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, forever ſat down on the right hand of God.</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelf for us an offering and aſacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> Let us then place no confidence in ſanctification, holineſs, faith, and the works that follow, as if theſe (ſaying aſide Chriſts death on the Croſs) could turn away Gods wrath and render God ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with us, as to diſcharge, acquit, juſtifie us; but let us by true faith repoſe all our truſt in Jeſus, who offered himſelf a ſacrifice for us, for juſtification, deliverance from wrath to come; He is the only <hi>hiding place from the ſtorm;</hi> the only <hi>covert from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. That for which God juſtifies us muſt ſuffice to <hi>ſatisfie his juſtice for our tranſgreſſion.</hi> But Chriſts ſufferings only, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done or ſuffered by us, can ſuffice to ſatisfie Gods juſtice for our tranſgreſſion. Therefore Chriſts ſufferings, and not any thing done or ſuffered by us, is that for which God doth juſtifie us. Juſtice is ſatisfied upon tranſgreſſion, when it hath duely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. This premiſed, I prove the <hi>Major.</hi> We having not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all, <hi>God will not juſtifie us without ſatisfaction to his juſtice for our ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We may judge of this by Gods dealing with <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> there being no proviſion made for the ſatisfaction of Juſtice for their fall; God will never juſtifie them: but they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and bear their deſerved puniſhment for ever. Why ſhould we imagine that God will juſtifie any of us, who have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len as well as they, never puniſhing our fall, as juſtice doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may conclude it from <hi>Gods Law;</hi> the contents whereof are all equal, holy, juſt, and good. In the Law we may take notice
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101119:62"/>of three things, each of which are concluſive of the point in hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods <hi>Judgement,</hi> which is alwaies according to truth; and he hath judged that whoever of us, in the leaſt tittle, do break ſo equal, ſo holy, juſt, and good a Law, we do deſerve his Curſe. If he had not thus judged, he would not have added this ſanction to his Law, and ſaid, Curſed is he that continues not in all. God judgeth this but a meet and deſerved puniſhment. And ſhall we imagine that God will not do what is meet to be done? That God ſhould not act according to his own Judgement? Hence I think, we may conclude God juſtifieth none of us without puniſhing our ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> God having ſaid in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die the death, and curſed is he that continues not in all; doth not his truth engage him to execute his juſtice in puniſhing ſin? ſhould mercy offer to pronounce any man abſolved, his ſin unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, Truth would ſtop the mouth of mercy, and ſay, hold, I have ſaid, Curſed is he that continues not in all, and I cannot but be true. Hence I conclude, no offender is juſtified but his ſin is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to the full.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods <hi>will and purpoſe;</hi> In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die the death. If it be his will and purpoſe to puniſh ſin in us, he doth it. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he.</hi> Then no fallen man is juſtified but is ſin is puniſhed, and ſo juſtice his ſatisfied for that his ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may demonſtrate it from <hi>Gods not ſparing his own Son,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> What made Gods juſtice lay on ſo? did Chriſt ever by ſin provoke to this? will God puniſh where there is no ſin? This is an <hi>Ocular demonstration.</hi> The Faith of a Believer that is juſtified can here ſee Juſtice puniſhing <hi>his</hi> tranſgreſſion; and that he is not juſtified without full ſatisfaction to Juſtice, God hath puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then the ſins of all that are juſtified in Jeſus Chriſt. And the Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. This became God. <hi>It became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons unto Glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> Did it not become God to act according to his Judgement? according to his Truth? according to his Juſtice? having executed his juſtice on ſome of his offending Creatures, fallen Angels; not to let the ſins of his other offending Creatures,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101119:62"/>fallen Men and Women, to go unpuniſhed? The point is clear, That for which God juſtifies us who have been Tranſgreſſors, muſt be that which ſatisfies his Juſtice for our Tranſgreſſions. The next <hi>Propoſition</hi> hath two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing done or ſuffered by us, can ſuffice to ſatisfie Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> Every known ſin is a wilful rejection of infinite Goodneſs, a free choice of infinite Diſpleaſure, a bold contempt of Infinite Majeſty, preſumptuous Rebellion againſt infinite Soveraignty; and a diſdainful making him a Liar, who is infinitely a Lover of Truth: It therefore carries inſinite demerit with it; and nothing ſhort of infinite puniſhment, or ſufferings of infinite wrath can poſſibly ſuffice to ſatisfie for it. But what proportion to Infinity can any thing we do or ſuffer, bear? Why do men lie in Hell to all eternity, but becauſe they are not able to bear a Curſe proportionable to the Infinity of Gods perfections, againſt whom they have offended? Faith, and the Works that follow, can this without the imputation of Chriſts Sufferings, ſatisfie Gods Majeſty for our ſin? It is Blaſphemy againſt God, it is moſt damnable Idolatry to ſuppoſe it. It is to debaſe God, and make him our Equal; this is Blaſphemy: It is to exalt our ſelves, and make our ſelves Gods Equal; this is Idolatry in the higheſt degree. For there is none but Gods equal, and this is God himſelf in our Nature, that is capable to ſatisfie God for ſin, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.17. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, O Sword, againſt my Shepherd, againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> If we crawling worms can ſatisfie Gods Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice any way for our ſins, then Chriſt received the Stroak of Gods Jvſtice in vain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts Sufferings ſuffice to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice.</hi> To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premiſe this Argument; If when we lay under the Sentence of Death, <hi>Chriſt became Surety for us, had our ſins imputed to him, died for us, God accepted his perſon, his Sacrifice, and for his ſake turns away his wrath from us, forgives us, frees us from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, is reconciled to us, ſaves us;</hi> then Chriſts Sufferings do ſuffice abundantly to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for our ſins.

When God judgeth it meet all ſin ſhould be puniſhed, when in his Threats he hath declared his Will and Purpoſe for it, bound himſelf by his Truth and Faithfulneſs; canſt thou yet ſay, what need have I of any Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſatisfie Juſtice for my ſins? When God ſpared not his Son, wilt thou ſay, what need theſe Stroaks of Juſtice? Yet if this Doctrine be true, God is cruel in this mans eyes. Poſſibly he will ſay too, If God doth damn the Impenitent, if he damnes the fallen angels, he is cruel; for he can command wrath. Can a King forgive all violation of his Laws without puniſhing any, and reign? It would not be his perfection, to do this, it would be his ſin. <hi>Eli</hi>'s not puniſhing his Sons, coſt him dear; and ſo did the like offence coſt <hi>David.</hi> The Lord would have us forgive private Injuries for his ſake, who will make us ſatisfaction, when the Offender cannot; as he himſelf is willing to forgive us for Chriſts ſake, who hath made him ſatisfaction, which we cannot, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Forgive one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> And ſince we have aſſurance that it is the free plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and purpoſe of God, according to the truth of his Word, and as he judgeth it meet to puniſh all ſin; and that he hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our ſin in his Son: how <hi>vain</hi> is it now to queſtion, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not God appeaſe his own wrath?

And for that perſon, who is God, to ſuffer a <hi>Temporal</hi> Death (though in his humane nature only) this is of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; an <hi>infinite abaſement, a ſtroak of infinite wrath;</hi> for had not Gods wrath againſt ſin been infinite, he would not thus have ſtruck <hi>a perſon of infinite worth and dearneſs</hi> to him, interpoſing as Surety between him and us miſerable ſinners. For <hi>God</hi> in our Nature to ſuffer what he did, this is more than for <hi>Men or Devils</hi> to ſuffer Gods eternal wrath or revenge; this wrath more clearly ſhines in the <hi>Infinitude</hi> of it, in thus ſmiting <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> than in the eternal damnation of Men and Devils in the unquenchable Flames of Hell.</p>

And further the Apoſtle tells us this was done that the purpoſe of Gods Election might ſtand or take place: So that God did but Act then as he had decreed of old to do. And further yet, the Apoſtle tells us, this Election is <hi>not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi> No mans good works fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen are the things that move God to chooſe, but it is the meer good pleaſure of God who effectually calls and prevails on whom he will.

               <p>Obj. p. 41. <hi>This puffs up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It works ſelf-abaſing admiration of Soveraign grace, it gives great reſt, and engageth the heart of a ſincere believer to an utter deteſtation of all ſin.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If the everlaſting ſtate of perſons is thus ſecured, all Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are impertinent and vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, God that decrees their ſalvation, decrees by ſuch warnings to work in them his fear, and a holy caution to keep in his ways that they may be ſaved. From this Doctrine of Election, thus manifeſted, thus vindicated by moſt evident conſequence, appears the Truth of the Doctrine of Reprobation. <hi>viz. That God hath rejected or refuſed others from all Eternity, or Decreed never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them by beſtowing ſaving grace on them; but for ſin to damn them, for the praiſe of the glory of his Juſtice.</hi> For if God hath choſen ſome, who can deny that he hath refuſed others? And the Scripture, if we will believe it, will make it manifeſt in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath refuſed ſome particular perſons. <hi>Jo.</hi> 10.26. <hi>You are not my ſheep.</hi> Rom. 11.7. <hi>The reſt were blinded.</hi> Rom. 9.18. <hi>Whom he will he hardeneth. Peter</hi> deſerved hardening as well as <hi>Judas;</hi> that God hardeneth <hi>Judas,</hi> not <hi>Peter,</hi> proceeds from the meer pleaſure of his Will. He makes, as the great <hi>Potter,</hi> what <hi>Veſſel</hi> he pleaſeth to <hi>diſhonour;</hi> that is, God makes him with an intention to ſuffer his fall, and never recover him by renewing grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath from Eternity thus refuſed them. <hi>Jude</hi> 4. <hi>There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to this Condemnation.</hi> Rev. 17.8. <hi>Whoſe Names were not written in the book of Life from the foundation of the World.</hi> Add this Argument. As there are <hi>Particular Angels</hi> whom God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to fall, though he could as eaſily have preſerved them from it as he did the reſt: ſo there are Particular Men and Women whom God never recovers by ſaving grace out of their fallen condition, though he could as eaſily have recovered them as others, if he had pleaſed; but he endures them with much long ſuffering to fit themſelves for deſtruction: Therefore from all Eternity did God decree thus to do concerning them in particular, for known to God are all his works from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God hath decreed to damn theſe perſons for ſin. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf, yea even
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101119:67"/>the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> He <hi>damneth particular perſons for ſin; therefore of old did he decree to damn thoſe particular men for ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12. <hi>As Beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroyed</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That all this is for the praiſe of the glory of his Juſtice. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much Long-ſuffering, Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction?</hi> And though God hath no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, conſidered barely as his Creature; for he is willing to receive to mercy every returning Sinner; yet if a perſon perſeveres in wickedneſs, as ſuch, God will laugh at his Calamity, and mock when his fear cometh.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of Reprobation being the Truth of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Scripture, from it I draw theſe Conſectaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it cannot be inconſiſtent with his <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> p. 42. <hi>Eat not.</hi> His <hi>Conditional Promiſes, If thou doſt well, ſhalt not thou be accepted? If you ſeek the Lord, be will be found of you. Whoſoever believeth ſhall not periſh; ſhall not abide in darkneſs.</hi> His <hi>Conditional Threats. If thy heart turn away, thou ſhalt periſh. If you forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> His <hi>ſending his Son</hi> into the world not to condemn the world. His <hi>giving his Spirit</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in theſe things. His <hi>ſetting Life and Death</hi> before them in the Promiſes, and in the Threats. Or his <hi>giving men up</hi> to their Luſts for ſin. For there can be no Repugnancy in Gods actions between themſelves. On the contrary, all theſe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Soveraign Deſign of Gods Decrees: the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mercy and Grace in the ſalvation of all the Elect, who enabled by his ſpecial Grace, to believe and obey, are ſaved, according to the Promiſes: the magnifying his Juſtice, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known his wrath in the Reprobates, who, according to the Soveraign Dominion of God, left to themſelves, reject Chriſt, and increaſe in their Rebellion againſt God, and ſo are juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up and damned, according to the Threats.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God is neither <hi>partial nor cruel</hi> in decreeing to deny ſaving Grace to ſome, whilſt he decrees to give it to others; that he is not the <hi>Author of ſin,</hi> in decreeing to permit, or in fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining it, <hi>p.</hi> 41, 42. For what God doth, can neither be partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor cruelty, nor unholineſs. Is he partial that gives his Alms where he pleaſeth? Is he cruel, that never denies any due Compaſſion? Who can prove, that converting, confirming Grace is a due Debt to every fallen man and woman? <hi>Who hath firſt given to him?</hi> Or is the Judge cruel, that hangs up a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101119:68"/>Murtherer? God doth <hi>actually</hi> damn none, but the finally impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>Chriſt, being delivered by the determinate Counſel and Fore-knowledge of God, you have taken, and by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> Chap. 4.27, 28. <hi>Againſt thy Holy Child Jeſus, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Governors and People of Iſrael, were gathered together, to do whatſoever thy Hand and thy Counſel determined before to be done.</hi> Is God the Author of Sin in determining or fore-ordaining the wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe men? It is one thing to <hi>decree the permiſſion</hi> of ſin, or to <hi>fore-ordain</hi> it; another thing to <hi>commit</hi> it. Between Gods fore-ordaining the ſin, and the actual commiſſion of it, came in the <hi>Will and Wicked Hands</hi> of men. This Will, and theſe wicked hands were the Author and Cauſe of ſin, and not Gods Fore-ordination.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it doth not become us to have <hi>the leaſt Riſings of heart</hi> againſt it, and ſay, as <hi>p.</hi> 41. <hi>If any are reprobated, they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Hell and Damnation whatever they do.</hi> Or as <hi>p.</hi> 45. <hi>Then the blame of mans Damnation is to be laid on God.</hi> This is the ſame with that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>For why doth he yet find fault, who hath reſiſted his Will?</hi> What the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the following Verſes, muſt quiet us, <hi>Nay, but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame Lump to make one Veſſel to Honour, another to Diſhonour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That it tends not to drive any to a <hi>ſinful Deſpair, p.</hi> 41. It is indeed a dreadful Doctrine, and to be trembled at; yet doth it leave room for comfort. It tends to make an impenitent man that loves his ſin, to deſpair of Salvation, whilſt ſuch; but this is a good Deſpair. But it tends not to make any that have not ſinned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, how vile ſoever they be, abſolutely to deſpair. Had the Lord paſſed by all, there had been no hopes for any, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Except the Lord had left us a Seed, we had been as Sodon, and been made like unto Gomorrah.</hi> But though all fallen Angels are, all fallen men and women are not reprobated. This is ſome comfort, and it importunately urgeth all, in compaſſion to their own immortal Souls, to turn from ſin to God in Chriſt, and to ſeek after good Scripture-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their Election. I ſhall lay down two or three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Haſt thou ever had a heart to <hi>chuſe</hi> Chriſt? <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.16.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101119:68"/>
                  <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you.</hi> He that can aſſure his own Soul, that he hath choſen Chriſt for his Saviour, for his Teacher, for his Governour, for his Portion, with his very heart and deareſt affections, may be confident he is a choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Haſt thou an heart to <hi>believe in</hi> Chriſt for Salvation? <hi>John</hi> 10.26. <hi>You believe not, becauſe you are not my ſheep.</hi> He that can be aſſured that ſeeing himſelf loſt in himſelf, and renouncing all truſt in his own performances, placeth all his confidence in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Death of Chriſt, for Pardon, Acceptance, ſhelter from wrath, and the ſalvation of his Soul, as <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew whom he had believed, and was perſwaded that he was able to keep what he had committed to him againſt that day; this perſon hath no ground to fear Reprobation. Thoſe that are not the ſheep, do never thus believe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hath God given thee <hi>power over thy Corruptions</hi> in ſome good meaſure? a <hi>heart to pray</hi> ſincerely? and a <hi>holy Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſo that thou liveſt not like the generality of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ye are a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People.</hi> Becauſe ye are choſen and dear to God, therefore doth Grace reign over ſin in you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have you hearts to ſeek God uprightly. Therefore are you lovers of Holineſs, and your Converſation differs from other men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is your <hi>heart ſpiritually tender?</hi> Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election hath obtained it, and the reſt were hardned.</hi> Rom. 9.14. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> You are not a Deſpiſer of Mercy, a Neglecter of Salvation, a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſon, giving your ſelf up to known ſinful Practices; but had rather loſe your life than miſs of Chriſt; do grieve for what hardneſs you find; do fear God; and would in nothing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. Are theſe things to be found in Reprobates? Let Gods Word give your heart ſecurity that you are not Reprobates. Yea, if <hi>heretofore</hi> you did in truth experience theſe things, but you are <hi>now</hi> afraid you have loſt all; for you have greatly fallen, as did <hi>David;</hi> you are ſorely ſcourged, as was <hi>Job;</hi> your Faith is even giving up the Ghoſt, with the Diſciples, <hi>We thought it had been he:</hi> yet <hi>are not you fallen from Grace, God hath not forſaken you,</hi> Pſal. 89.30. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101119:69"/>my Judgments, I will viſit their Tranſgreſſions with a Rod; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my righteouſneſs to fail.</hi> Nor <hi>have you totally forſaken your God.</hi> Peter, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not. Nor ever ſhall you</hi> totally forſake him; for <hi>the foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this Seal to it, the Lord knows them that are his.</hi> There is <hi>a Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for you,</hi> who have ſeemingly loſt your Faith. <hi>Thomas, reach hither thy ſinger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide; and be not faithleſs, but believing.</hi> And you <hi>ſhall yet find more ſtrength</hi> againſt the Devil and your own Corruptions; more warineſs, love to God than ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Therefore ſtill <hi>hope</hi> you in God, ſtill <hi>truſt</hi> in your faithful Advocate. <hi>Seek the Lord and his ſtrength; ſeek his face evermore.</hi> Never caſt him off, that <hi>will not break a bruiſed Reed.</hi> Strive to be more and more <hi>holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> Faint not, nor be diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Lord is your God for ever and ever; he will be your Guide unto death: He <hi>will not forſake his People; becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now, through Gods help, finiſhed this Work; and do hope, that through theſe poor Labours of mine, God will give ſome that are miſtaken, others that are ſtaggering, to diſcern the dangerous Errours of theſe People, and avoid them. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if Perſons whoſe hearts the Lord hath framed, with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of mind, to embrace Truth, and only Truth; if Perſons to whom Truth is precious, becauſe proceeding from God, and leading to him again; if theſe do but ſee that <hi>where there is no Election among fallen Creatures, there is no Salvation;</hi> which is plainly viſible in the fallen Angels; they will readily and gladly, and thankfully embrace the Doctrine of Election. If theſe were but perſwaded that <hi>they are curſed who ever diminiſh from Gods Word;</hi> they will be afraid to reject Chriſts Ordinances of the Supper and of Baptiſm by Water. If theſe heartily believe, (and they will) that <hi>Chriſt did not die in vain:</hi> Oh, they will be torn Limb from Limb, rather than part with that moſt precious, ſoul-ſaving Doctrine of the Imputation of Chriſt Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to loſt Sinners for Juſtification. If theſe do but yield,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101119:69"/>
                  <hi>Salvation is not now attainable by the Covenant of Works;</hi> that <hi>this Law is now weak through the fleſh, that it cannot give Life:</hi> How will they at once let go all hope of attaining perfection in themſelves here, and deſirouſly ſeek to have Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to them, that they may be found in him; bleſſing, praiſing and admiring God, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to provide it for undone Sinners, and invite them to it. If theſe perſons do but ſeriouſly conſider that <hi>Adam fallen, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Light he brought with him into the world, was not able to attain to the knowledge of Chriſt, till God revealed him.</hi> They will ſurely conclude, the bare Light every man brings with him into the world, cannot be ſaving. And if theſe perſons do but believe verily, <hi>the Lord doth beſtow on his Church and People a ſafer and better Rule to walk by, than he beſtows on the Heathen that know not God;</hi> they will embrace the Scripture for their Rule, and not prefer the Light that is in every man, as a ſafer and better Rule. Theſe are the Truths I contend for; and theſe, I doubt not, will be precious in the eyes of thoſe whom God loves to the end of the World.</p>
